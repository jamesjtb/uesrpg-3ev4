# UESRPG 3e v4
This system is a fork of the original uesrpg d100 system created by DogBoneZone at https://gitlab.com/DogBoneZone/uesrpg-3e.

A system and a few compendiums used to play the UESRPG game. Special thanks to 2Minute Tabletop and to drhodesw for the tokens and help creating the compendiums.

Express permission to use the artwork and tokens included in the compendiums of this system was given by 2MinuteTabletop and the copyright holder.
