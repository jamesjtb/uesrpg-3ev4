# UESRPG 3e v4
This system is a fork of the original uesrpg d100 system created by DogBoneZone at https://gitlab.com/DogBoneZone/uesrpg-3e.

A system and a few compendiums used to play the UESRPG game. Special thanks to 2Minute Tabletop and to drhodesw for the tokens and help creating the compendiums.

Express permission to use the artwork and tokens included in the compendiums of this system was given by 2MinuteTabletop and the copyright holder.

You can find the lively UESRPG Discord Community here: https://discord.gg/KAkXdf9

## Contributing
### Contributing to the Compendium (non-developers)
This guide is written for those who would like to help with the entry of content data, but don't necessarily have the skillset to contribute to the project directly.

#### Requirements
- Basic ability to navigate your computer's files
- A file archiving utility (winzip, 7-zip, winrar, etc)
- The latest version of Foundry VTT, locally installed
  - *while this guide can be followed using the remote files on a hosted foundry server, you will need to rely on the host's documentation for file exploration and manipulation*
- The latest version of uesrpg-3ev4 system module (see [Installing](#installing))
- A Foundry world that you can use as your work environment

#### Making and Submitting Compendium Changes (WIP)
**IMPORTANT!!** You should be starting from the latest unmodified version of the uesrpg-3ev4 system. If you've modified your system compendiums prior to starting a new set of work, you will need to uninstall and reinstall the uesrpg-3ev4 system in foundry. If you do not, you could cause data corruption once you've handed off your changes to a developer.

1. Find your \<foundry data folder\>, and take note of its path for later. On Windows, this can usually be found in `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\FoundryVTT`.

  Hint: if you're unable to find the folders in this path, make sure you "show hidden files" in Windows File Explorer.
