# Chapter 3: Skills

> “To achieve true mastery, you must understand what it is you’re doing. It ain’t simply enough to perform a perfect thrust of a blade -- you must also know what you are doing and why.”  
> — Seryne Relas, *“Breathing Water”*

Most tasks that a character can perform are measured by their skills. Skill ranks reflect the character’s experience, training, and overall ability to perform these actions. Skills are either trained or untrained. Each trained skill has a corresponding Skill Rank, which has an associated value from 0 to 5. This reflects how capable the character is at utilizing that skill. Each skill has one or more Governing Characteristics: a set of characteristics that reflect the many ways that a character can utilize a single skill.

When a character makes a skill test, they apply a bonus equal to +10 times the value of their skill rank (starting at +0 for novice [rank 0], and up to +50 at master [rank 5]) to the chosen characteristic. Typically the player chooses which characteristic to use, but the GM may require that they must use a particular one if they feel the circumstances dictate such. If a character uses an untrained skill, the test suffers a -20 penalty.

## Specializations

Trained skills can also have accompanying Specializations, which represent areas of concentration and focus in a character’s training and experience with that skill. A character may take as many specializations as their rank in a given skill for 100 Xp each. When making a skill test in the listed area of specialization, the character gains an additional +10 bonus to the test. A character may not benefit from more than one specialization at once. Example specializations are provided for each skill, but players should feel free to create their own with GM permission.

## Skill Types

There are two types of skills, Standard Skills and Field Skills. Standard skills function as described above, but field skills are different and can be identified by the “[Field]” in their name.

Field skills are collections of related skills that all function independently as standard skills. For example: Profession [Smithing] and Profession [Medicine] function as separate skills that must be trained and ranked up independently. Both skills have their own separate skill rank, though they function similarly because they share the same “parent” skill. Sometimes the fields will share governing characteristics, but sometimes each will have its own.

## Learning and Advancing Skills

The XP cost to learn a skill (upgrade it to trained, novice rank) is 100 XP. From then on, the cost to advance to the desired rank varies. Skill ranks are advanced in order.

## Favored Skills

A character’s favored skills are those skills that are governed by at least one of the character’s Favored Characteristics. Favored skills cost 75% of the usual XP to advance in rank or gain a specialization in (round down to the nearest multiple of 5).

## Skill Ranks

| Skill Rank (Value) | Bonus | Total XP Required | XP Required (total) | Equivalence |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Untrained | -20 | — | — | No knowledge. |
| Novice (0) | +0 | — | 100 | Rudimentary knowledge. |
| Apprentice (1) | +10 | 1000 | 200 (300) | Basic proficiency. |
| Journeyman (2) | +20 | 2500 | 300 (600) | Competent. |
| Adept (3) | +30 | 4000 | 400 (1000) | Extensive experience or training. |
| Expert (4) | +40 | 5500 | 500 (1500) | Professional level ability. |
| Master (5) | +50 | 7000 | 800 (2300) | Complete mastery. |

## Combat Styles

Fighting skills are packaged into Combat Styles, which represent the complete package of training, tactics, and experience that constitutes a specific style of combat. Combat Styles can be associated with culture, careers, or even schools of combat.

Specifically, individual Combat Styles are represented by the Combat Style [Field] skill, where the field is the name of the combat style. This skill is used to make melee (or ranged) attack and defense tests in combat when using the equipment associated with the style. The character may use either their Strength or Agility as a base for the skill test when making melee attacks and most defense tests but must use their Agility when making ranged attacks.

Rather than creating preset combat styles we have allowed players and GMs to invent their own to more accurately reflect the characters they wish to portray. Each combat style should be accompanied by a list of equipment it incorporates (see below), and a description of the style of fighting that it represents (see examples to the bottom right).

### Trained Equipment

Each Combat Style has an associated set of weapon, armor, and shield types. A character with that Combat Style is capable of using that equipment effectively in the situations the style is designed for. Combat Styles may include up to five different types of equipment when the skill is purchased for the first time. Unarmed combat is included in this category as well, reflecting that the character is trained to fight without weapons.

Armor is divided into types using the associated weight class quality: light, medium, heavy, or super heavy. Armor without a quality requires no training.

Each style’s associated trained equipment is chosen when the character learns the style, and it can be expanded to a maximum of ten different types of equipment. Expanding a combat style by adding a weapon, armor, or shield type to the list of a style’s trained equipment costs 25 XP.

### Special Advantages

In addition to equipment, each Combat Style also has an associated set of Special Advantages. This list is a set of Special Actions (page 100) that the character is able to use as an advantage instead of the listed action type.

A Combat Style starts with a single chosen Special Action in this list of Special Advantages. Expanding this list of Special Advantages costs 25 XP per Special Action. There is no limit to the number of Special Advantages that can be included in a Combat Style.

When the character uses this Special Action as an advantage, they ignore the AP cost, or automatically win any opposed roll involved.

### Fighting in Unfamiliar Circumstances

Occasionally characters may be forced to fight with familiar weapons, but in strange circumstances. For example, a noble who is used to fighting honorable one-on-one duels might be forced into a chaotic bar-brawl. Or perhaps a battlefield soldier used to fighting on horseback finds themself face to face with an assassin at home.

Generally most characters are trained to use the weapons in their style in widely applicable circumstances, but in certain cases like these the GM shouldn’t be afraid to impose a -10 penalty (or more, if appropriate) on Combat Style tests made by a character who is out of their element.

> “The Prince’s longblade slashed across the Akavir’s chest and the sudden, intense pain caused him to drop both his weapons. In a moment, it was over. Savirien-Chorak was prostrate in the dust with the Prince’s longsword at his throat. ‘The game’s over!’ shouted the Emperor, barely heard over the applause from the stadium.”  
> — *“2920, The Last Year of the First Era”*

### Utilizing Untrained Weapons/Armor

Characters who use weapons, armor, or other equipment that they are not trained to use suffer the usual -20 penalty for using an untrained skill on any associated combat tests, movement tests in the case of armor, or any other tests that the GM deems appropriate. The GM may choose to alter or ignore this penalty if they feel the circumstances do not apply.
