Magic is the general term used for the focusing of the
energy that flows from Aetherius into Mundus by way of the
and stars into various properties and for various purposes. Th
energy is often referred to as magicka. All magical energy co
from Aetherius, and from its magicka Mundus was crea
Magicka comprises every spirit; it is the energy of all liv
things and can be harnessed in a variety of ways. This cha
contains rules for magic in its most common forms, as we
other aspects of the arcane that may be relevant in the co
of the players’ adventure.
The various magic effects are divided into parent School
magic. Exactly which schools are recognized, and how the
organized, varies from era to era in Tamriel, but for the s
of simplicity this rulebook will utilize the following schoo
- The school of Alteration revolves around altering
physical and magical properties of the world. This
be used to augment the self and allies, or hinder enem
- The school of Conjuration focuses on calling upon
erworldly entities. These entities can manifest in a num
of different forms.
- The school of Destruction centers on harming target
a variety of ways. Either through direct damage or sapp
their abilities and defenses.
- The school of Illusion focuses on affecting light and
minds of sentient targets. Illusion can be used to manipu
an enemy’s perception of reality, or augment one’s ow
- The school of Mysticism is a more obscure school,
its spells manipulate magicka itself. Mysticism can be u
for many effects, including binding and trapping soul
reflecting spells.
- The morally grey school of Necromancy is a school s
ied by outcasts and morally flexible mages. Necroman
are masters of the undead, commanding them to do t
bidding.
- The school of Restoration revolves around augmen
and restoring the abilities and body of a target. It
contains effects that can be used against the undead.
> Note - Schools
The makeup of the schools of magic have varied drastically
over the eras. The division portrayed here is the one
utilized in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind (with the
exception of Necromancy). If playing a game in a different era, it is possible to simply “regroup” the spells and
effects to reflect the historically correct school-division.
Alternatively the group can simply leave things as they are
for convenience.
There are a number of ways that any given magical effect can be
manifested. The main four methods of using magic (listed below)
are the focus of this chapter, as they are the most common
means of manipulating magicka.
- Spellcasting allows characters to draw on their own
magicka reserves in order to generate an effect in the
physical world. Spell casters cast spells using the skill corresponding to the school of magic that the spell is associated
with. Casters either learn spells or create them from ones
they already know, though this can be risky.
- Enchanting involves using the magicka from souls themselves to fuel magic “stored” within an object. Enchanters
can use the Enchanting skill to create a number of different
items with many possible effects.
- Alchemy uses the magicka trapped within different things
as power to fuel potions with magical effects. Alchemists
can use the Alchemy skill to create a variety of potions.
- Ritual Magic is a form of spellcasting that, while it often
requires extensive preparation, can produce potent effects.
Thus Ritual Magic uses the six standard spellcasting Skills,
though the amount of power involved means that rituals
can prove quite dangerous if botched.
Racial and Birthsign powers can be found in Powers in Chapter
2. Other advanced forms of magic exist as well: their rules can
be found in Chapter 8: Elite Advances (page 188).

## Spellcasting
Spellcasting is the act of drawing on one’s own magicka rese
in order to generate some sort of effect on the world. Spells
be used to create, change, destroy, or manipulate the world
the beings within it.
### Spell Components
Casting spells requires a combination of physical compon
(typically precise hand motions), verbal components (in
tations or words of power), and the mental componen
channeling one’s magicka into the desired effect. Charac
can combine all three of these components in order to prod
a magical effect, which is known as casting a spell.
### Spell Levels
Each spell’s Spell Level is used to determine how m
magicka it costs for a character to cast (the specific cost wi
listed with the spell). Higher level spells produce more powe
effects. Each level of a spell is its own distinct spell and m
be learned separately. Some spells have fewer than 7 lev
| Spell Level | Name |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Novice |
| 2 | Apprentice |
| 3 | Journeyman |
| 4 | Adept |
| 5 | Expert |
| 6 | Master |
| 7 | Grandmaster |
Learning a spell takes a number of days equal to the l
of the spell and typically requires a character to study fr
a spell tome or learn from a teacher.
### Spell Schools
Each spell has one or more associated schools of magic. These
reflect the type of effect the spell generates and also determine
which skill(s) the character must use in order to cast it.
### Spell Types
In addition to whatever school it is associated with, spells fall
into one of two types: Conventional or Unconventional spells.
Conventional Spells are “tried and true” spells that fall clearly
within a single school and produce only a single effect. They are
spells that have been refined over generations by the mages of
Tamriel: simple incantations and patterns that produce reliable
effects. In game terms conventional spells are premade spells;
they exist as a set of easy premade options to choose from.
Unconventional Spells are spells that produce more than a
single effect, can be classified as belonging to more than one
school, or are simply a unique variation on a standard effect.
These spells are considered the realm of over-eager apprentices
and learned masters: experimental magic that can bring great
risks and great rewards. In game terms unconventional spells
are custom spells; they are how players can tinker with magic.
### Spell Attributes
Many spells have attributes listed in their profiles that modify
their rules or clarify how they function in game terms. The
effects for these attributes are detailed in the Conventional
Spells section later in this chapter.
### Effect Durations
Effect durations are measured in rounds and end immediately
after the initiative step on which they took effect. For example,
if an Orc is stunned for 2 rounds on their Turn, they remain
stunned until right after the end of their Turn 2 rounds later
(assuming their Turn takes place at the same initiative “step” as
it did originally).

### Casting Spells
In structured time, characters use the Cast Magic action to
spells. Follow these steps to resolve spellcasts:
Step 1: Caster Declares Spell and Targets
First the caster must choose a spell to cast from among those
know. If the spell has a target (or targets) other than them
they must choose them now provided they satisfy the s
conditions (range, etc).
Step 2: Casting Test
The caster makes a skill test with the skill corresponding to
school of the spell (the Destruction skill for Destruction sp
and so forth). This test suffers a -10 penalty for each p
by which the spell level exceeds the character’s Spellcast
Level with that spell. Their Spellcasting Level is determi
by taking the spell’s school skill level and adding one. If
character is untrained in that school’s skill, the Spellcas
Level in that school is considered zero, and they cannot
spells from that school.
### Spell Components
If the character cannot speak they suffer a -20 penalty to
casting test. They suffer an additional -20 penalty to the te
they do not have two free hands, either because they are hold
items or because their movement is restricted in some way
Step 3: Resolve the Spell
Pass or fail, the caster reduces their magicka by the listed co
the spell. If this would reduce the character’s magicka to be
zero, then the spell is not successfully cast.
If the caster passed the test, resolve the effects of the spe
written. If the character is casting a multi-part spell, then res
each part of the spell simultaneously (meaning that none of
parts benefit from the effects of any of the other parts).
Attack Spells
Spells with the attack attribute count as attacks. They are
resolved as appropriate for an attack of that type (either ranged
or melee):
- The casting test for the spell is also the attack test, and the
caster’s degrees of success are compared to the defender’s.
- Spell casting tests can suffer from circumstantial modifiers
that the GM rules are appropriate.
- Spells cannot gain or benefit from advantages.
- Spells cannot be parried or countered, only blocked/evaded.
- Critical successes cause damaging spells to deal maximum
damage. Non-damaging spells double their Magicka cost
reduction from Spell Restraint (still subject to the 1 cost
minimum).
- Spells cannot benefit from the use of Stamina Point abilities.
- Spells with the AoE attribute are resolved as AoE attacks.
### Spell Restraint
On a successful spellcast, a mage can use their will to limit
excessive use of magicka. This is known as Spell Restraint
or restrained spellcasting. A character can choose to reduce the
cost of a successfully cast spell by their Willpower bonus to a
minimum of 1.
While typically this is desirable, sometimes not holding back
with a spell can have extra benefits. Some spells have the
Overload attribute, which will state certain extra effects the
character can benefit from if they choose not to restrain the
spell when casting it.
Magical Backfires
If a character critically fails when casting a spell, or fails normally
when casting either an unconventional spell or any spell with a
spell level above their Spellcasting Level in the corresponding
school, then they suffer a Magical Backfire. A Magical Backfire is
an uncontrolled, and often harmful, consequence of incorrectly
manipulating unfamiliar magic. Find the table corresponding to
the backfired spell’s school in the Magical Mishaps (page 156)
section, roll a d4, and add the spell level to the result of the roll.
### Resolving Opposing Spell Effects
Certain spell effects can be seen as opposing (Frenzy and Calm,
for instance), which can bring some confusion if a target struck
by one is then hit by the other. Resolve all such instances by
simply assuming that the newer spell effect overrides the old one.
Unless otherwise specified, spell effects do not stack with
themselves (multiple fortify spells do not stack on top of
one another, for example).

Conventional spells are “tried and true” spells that fall cle
within a single school and produce only a single effect. They
spells that have been refined over generations by the mage
Tamriel: simple, elegant incantations and patterns that prod
reliable effects. This section contains rules for using conventi
spells and a full list of them.
Spell Profiles
Each conventional spell profile listed here includes the fol
ing: the name of the spell, its school, its spell level(s)/stren
corresponding magicka costs, spell attributes, and rules
resolving the spell. The Spell Strength of a spell is simp
variable that is used to quantify the strength of the spell in
rules entry, and that is based on the spell level.
| Spell Level | Name |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Novice |
| 2 | Apprentice |
| 3 | Journeyman |
| 4 | Adept |
| 5 | Expert |
| 6 | Master |
| 7 | Grandmaster |
Unless otherwise specified, spell effects do not stack w
themselves.
### Spell Attributes
Many spells have attributes listed in their profiles that modify
their rules or clarify how they function in game terms. The rules
for spell attributes apply to all types of spells but are included
in this section for convenience:
- Attack: Using this effect is considered an Attack for the
purposes of determining Attacks per round.
- Instant: This spell can be cast using a Secondary Action,
permitting the caster to either cast the spell on their Turn
or as a Reaction outside of their Turn.
- Upkeep: The caster can, as a Free Action, refresh
the effect (including any required tests or rolls, not
including the casting test, using the original target(s))
and duration of this spell when it ends by paying the
original cost that they paid for the spell as long as the
requirements for the spell (like range) are still met.
If the spell has no listed duration, then treat the effect as
having a 1 round duration for the purposes of upkeep.
Additionally, spells with no listed duration cannot be if
they have cast a different spell since the original cast of
the upkept spell. If a spell has the Attack attribute, then
upkeeping the spell counts toward the maximum attacks
per round limit.
- Overload: The caster benefits from an extra effect (as specified) if not restraining this spell.
- Reinforce: By default, spells with the Reinforce attribute
have no extra effects. When a character takes the Mage
Guard and the Arcane Defender (page 83) talents, they
benefit from a bonus to the spell effect if not restraining
the spell.
- Ranged (range): Spell can affect a target within the listed
range.
- Melee (range): Spell counts as melee with the listed range.
Does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
- AoE (range, form): This spell counts as a ranged, area of
effect of the given form/radius. Pulse form AoEs affect
the caster.
- Direct: This spell has a target or targets but is not an attack
and cannot be defended against by normal means.
- Mindlock (X): Reduces the caster’s max AP by X to a
minimum of zero.
- [ Variation]: This spell has multiple variations, each corresponding to one of the listed items. Each variation is its
own spell that must be learned separately.

The school of Alteration revolves around altering the phys
and magical properties of the world. This can be used to
ment the self and allies or hinder enemies.

Summons a Daedra with the Summoned trait, which appears
within five meters of the caster. Immediately after being summoned, the Daedra must make a Willpower test against the
DoS of the Conjuration test. If the Conjurer wins the test, the
Daedra gains the Bound trait and persists for one round. If
the Daedra wins the Opposed test, it is not Bound and can act
as it pleases, typically murdering its summoner. The unbound
Daedra can test Willpower at the end of each round to maintain
itself in Mundus.
Keeping the Daedra in line imposes [Spell Str] Mindlock on
the caster. Roll initiative for the Daedra when it’s summoned,
as it acts on its own Turn. If the spell ends because the caster
chooses not to upkeep this spell and the summoned creature
has the Bound trait, the creature loses the Summoned trait and
returns to their plane of origin.
If this spell is restrained, the summoned creature’s Maximum AP
is reduced by 1 while they have the Bound trait. If the Spell is
Upkept, summoned creatures do not retest their Willpower test.

Unlike the “tried and true” conventional spells, unconventio
spells are the realm of unique, experimental, and potent
dangerous magic.
Unconventional Spells are spells that produce more th

These spells are considered the realm of over-eager apprent
and learned masters: experimental magic that can bring b
great risks and great rewards.
In game terms unconventional spells are custom spells. Th

spells that can be created from the various magical eff
and forms that exist within the system. This section cont
rules for creating and using your own unconventional spe
Important Note
The creation and use of Unconventional Spells provides
casters with a powerful system to customize their spell
arsenal and is integral to the classic Elder Scrolls experience. This system was designed with flexibility and
customization as priorities, which leaves it vulnerable to
the creation of over-powered spells and spell effect combinations. Players should always review Unconventional
Spells with their GM before they are implemented in
play.
### Creating a Spell
Creating an unconventional spell is a matter of putting pi
together to make a functioning spell that can be used like
of the premade conventional spells.
### The Basics
The two pieces that players can combine to create spells
called effects and forms.
An Effect is the actual content of a spell: the fire effect ca
fire damage while the heal effect heals it. A Form is the “sh
of the spell. Some spells are cast across wide areas (like a fire
which uses the “ball” form) while others are cast only on
caster themself (the “self” form).
Creating a spell is a matter of combining effects and fo
that are allowed to fit together, setting the parameters of e
and then writing down the combined result so that you
reference it during gameplay.
Multi-Part Spells
Unconventional spells can also be multi-part spells, which simply
means that they contain multiple spells in a single spell. For
example a character might create a spell that when cast allows
them to both jump further and walk on water, which are two
separate effects. These distinct parts are referred to as Spell Parts,
while the spell containing them is referred to as the Parent Spell.
When a character is casting a multi-part spell, they should resolve
each part of the spell simultaneously (meaning that none of the
parts benefit from the effects of any of the other parts).
Learning Effects & Forms
A character can use any form when creating an unconventional
spell, but may only utilize effects from schools of magic in which
they are trained (meaning the skill is novice rank or higher).
### Spell Attributes
Spell attributes are “tags” that modify the rules of a spell or clarify
how they function in game terms. Effects and forms each have
spell attributes associated with them that are combined when
the complete spell profile is created.
Reference Materials
A complete list of effects, forms, and spell attributes can be
found in the Spell Making Reference in the Appendix.
To create an unconventional spell, follow these steps:
Step 1: Create Spell Parts
First pick the combination(s) of effects and forms that will make
up the various part(s) of the spell.
Step 2: Determine Spell Parameters
Next, decide on the parameters of each effect/form. Each effect
and form have associated parameters (spell level and magnitude)
that determine the strength of the effect and the size of the
form, respectively.
Step 3: Determine Spell Cost
Once the spell parameters are decided, simply “plug in” your
chosen values into the effect cost and form cost formulas provided for your chosen effect(s) and form(s). The total cost of
all these values added together for each spell part is the total
magicka cost of the spell.
Step 4: Determine Spell Level & School
The spell level of an unconventional spell is equal to the highest
spell level used in one of that spell’s parts. If the parent spell has
multiple parts, increase this level by one for each part beyond
the first. The school of a spell is the school of its highest level
spell part.

---

<!-- PDF page 22 | Rulebook p.146 -->
Step 5: Create Spell
To create a spell a character must pass an extended skill test u
that spell’s school. The success threshold for the creation te
three times the spell’s level, and each test the character ma
represents a day of experimentation and study. For each
the character makes they must also consume experime
materials worth approximately 25 drakes. This represents
unpredictable nature of magical experimentation and the
that creating a spell requires both time and resources.
Step 6: Finalize Spell
Write down the details of the new spell somewhere you can
reference it, including its cost, level, attributes, and various
parts. Add this spell to your character’s list of known spells, and
be sure to give it an appropriate name!

## Rituals
Ritual magic is a hybrid of the other forms of magic combin
elements of spellcasting, enchanting, and alchemy into exten
rituals that require preparation and can achieve extremely p
erful effects.
Rituals require a source of magicka, which is used to pay
ritual’s cost, and require the character to prepare for a cer
amount of time. The purpose of the ritual is to amplify
power of the source of magicka chosen. Because characters
harnessing so much energy, there is always a potential for da
if the character errs in the ritual.
Rituals require specific steps and have unique magical eff
They represent more obscure forms of magic, often known
to a few. Each one must be learned independently and ha
own steps that must be taken, costs that must be paid,
penalties for failure.
Because rituals represent obscure, specialized forms of magic,
GM should not allow just any character to learn them. Learn
a ritual costs 25 XP and the character must have some me
of learning the ritual (such as a book or a teacher).
every character should be allowed to learn every ritual (G
discretion). Below are a few of the many such rituals that e
Players and GMs are encouraged to collaborate in orde
create their own.
Ritual Spellcasting
Ritual spellcasting is a means of utilizing rituals to power a spell.
A character can perform a ritual in order to utilize alternative
magicka sources to power a particularly costly spell.
### Magicka Source and Ritual Focus
The character must choose a source of magicka to fuel the spell.
Characters may use their own magicka reserves, a unit of alchemical ingredients, a filled soul gem, or any combination of any
number of the above. If multiple characters are cooperating to
perform a ritual, they can combine their magicka pools for the
purposes of paying the magicka cost of the spell.
Additionally, each ritual requires a ritual focus. This is an item,
which can differ from ritual to ritual, that focuses and amplifies
the magic forces involved in the ritual. The nature of this item is
left to the GM (though they should feel free to pass this decision
off to the player performing the ritual), but it should be in some
way thematically related to the ritual being performed. This can
be anything from a human heart to an ornate tattoo created on
the body of the character performing the ritual. The only limit
is the imagination of the GM and the players.
### Resolve Ritual
The magicka cost must be paid from the chosen magicka source.
If the character is using their own magicka reserves, simply
deduct the cost as you would for a spell. If the character is using
a soul gem, deduct the cost from its soul energy and destroy the
gem. If the character is using alchemical ingredients, deduct
the cost from the ingredient pool and destroy the ingredients.
If the cost would reduce the magicka in the magicka source to
below zero, then the casting fails automatically. If the character
passed their casting test, the spell is resolved as it normally would.
If the character failed their casting test, the spell is not cast and
the ritual has backfired. Roll on the backfire table corresponding
to the school of the spell and add one to the resulting roll
for each degree of failure. Rules for backfires can be found in
Magical Mishaps (page 156).

### Rite of Conjuring
The Rite of Conjuring creates a magic circle that is able to h

caster. Creating the magic circle requires 1000 drakes wort

If the circle is imperfect the Daedra is summoned unbo

murder the conjurer and everyone in the immediate area.
Additionally, the caster may choose to conjure a bound Dae
weapon instead of creature. To do so, create the circle as nor
and place an ebony item in it. Make the Conjuration tes
normal, as well as spend either a Daedra heart or soul gem fi
with the soul of a Daedra.
If successful, the ebony item is transformed into a Dae
item of the same type. If the Daedra in which the heart or
energy came from was 500 or lower, the weapon is of Infe
quality, if it was 501-1000, it is of standard quality, and
was 1001-1500, it is of Superior quality.
### Rite of the Creation of Flesh
Powerful mages, often necromancers, know the ritual to use
flesh and the essence of Daedra to form a Flesh Atronach bound
to their will.
To do so requires 6 hours of work correctly filling a circle with
Osseous Marrow, Dermis Membrane, Essence of Breath and
Blood Liqueur. These special ingredients can rarely be bought,
and must instead be found. They can be harvested from slain
Daedra by making a -20 Alchemy test limited by Lore, though
a single Daedra can only usually supply one of these at a time.
Once the ingredients are harvested and placed in the circle,
as well as the 6 hours have passed, make a +0 Conjuration or
Necromancy test. On a success, the Flesh Atronach raises from
the circle with the Bound trait. The atronach has no weaponry
when raised, so you must affix it yourself. Your GM should
handle how you may find or create the atronach’s weaponry,
either by finding a smith to do it or something else.
If the character wishes to create a Hulking Flesh Atronach it
instead requires two of each ingredient but follows the same
ritual process.
### Rite of Focus
Allows a character to turn a weapon into a magical “focus”
through which Magicka can be channeled. This requires an
hour of ritual preparation followed by a five minute ritual and
an Enchant test made at a +0 bonus. The character must also
pay 200 magicka from any source using the rules for ritual
spellcasting. On success, weapon gains the Focus quality.
### Rite of Morpholithic Inscription
Allows a character to create a Sigil Stone. This requires a rare
Daedric morpholith: a variety of soul gem found only in
Oblivion. This ritual is guarded knowledge known only to the
most experienced masters of Conjuration and Mysticism. The
character must first prepare a chamber sealed against all daylight
and disturbances, roofed and walled with white stone, and
floored with black tiles. All surfaces within the chamber must
be ritually purified with a solution of void salts (an expensive
alchemical ingredient [mysticism]).
A foursquare table must be placed in the center of a room with
a dish to receive the morpholith. Four censers shall be prepared
with incense compounded from gorvix (an expensive alchemical
ingredient [mysticism]) and harrada (an expensive alchemical
ingredient [conjuration]).

---

<!-- PDF page 25 | Rulebook p.149 -->
On the equinox, the character must place the morpholith in
dish and intone the rites specified in the Book of Law, beginn
at dawn and continuing without end until sunset of the s
day. They must also choose a Daedric Prince whom they
attempting to contact and make a Mysticism skill test wi
- 20 penalty to see if they successfully performed the rites.
The character may then present the purified morpholith to
Daedric Prince for their inscription, assuming the Prince de
them worthy. Once inscribed, the morpholith is transform
into a Sigil Stone. Such an inscription represents a cont
between the character and the Prince in question, which
be invoked through further use of the Sigil Stone.
If the character fails the Mysticism test, the ritual backfires.

Using the Stone
In the future, if character communicates directly with
Daedric Prince who inscribed the Sigil Stone, they may inv
the compact (known as the conjurational charter) between
two of them. The character then activates the charged S
Stone (with a Mysticism skill test). This transports the st
through the liminal barrier, opening a portal between Mun
and the Prince’s realm of Oblivion. The portal may only rem
open for a short period of time (a minute at most), and
the Daedric Prince who gets to decide where the portal le
within their realm.
If the character fails the Mysticism test, the ritual backfires.
2d4 + 3 on the mysticism backfire effect table.
### Rite of Motion
Allows a character to teleport themselves, or several people,
vast distances. The ritual requires a magic circle be created, w
requires a Mysticism skill test. The GM should make this
for the character in secret, and note the results. Knowledg
this ritual is uncommon to most mages.
The ritual itself is an hour long incantation, requirin
Mysticism skill test with a -20 penalty. The character must
pay 500 magicka, which can be paid with any magicka sourc
per the normal rules for ritual spellcasting. Any characters w
will be teleported must be within the circle throughout. W
the character makes the test, they must choose a target loca
This can be anywhere that they have ever been, or scried, as l
as they can clearly picture the location in their mind. If
pass the test, any characters within the circle (which can incl
the character) are instantly transported to that location. If
caster rolls an unlucky number on the test the characters
sent to a random location instead (chosen by the GM).
Alternatively, the active character can utilize the memories of
some other character (assuming they are within the circle) to
determine the target location. This requires a Willpower test
on the part of the character providing the memories and adds
a -10 penalty to the active character’s Mysticism test.
### Rite of Princely Summoning
Masters of Conjuration are able to summon the presence of
the Daedric Princes themselves using a technique unknown to
most mages. To summon a Daedric Prince’s presence, the caster
must perform a ritual containing many complex incantations
that takes 6 hours on the Prince in question’s Summoning
Day (as shown below). At the conclusion of the ritual, make
a Conjuration test at -30. On a success, the Prince hears the
caster’s summons and may answer them if they so wish.
If the ritual is done on a day other than the prince’s summoning day, roll a d10. On a 10, the Prince entertains the caster’s
summons. On a 4-9, nothing happens. On a 2-3, the Daedric
Prince is insulted and smites the caster, dealing 10d10 Magic
damage. On a 1, the Prince hears the caster’s summons, though
will most likely not be happy being disturbed when it is not
their Summoning Day.
Additionally, if the caster is attempting to summon a Daedric
Prince on their Summoning Day and it is storming with thunder,
on a d10 roll of a 8+ Sheogorath appears instead.

1st of Morning Star - Clavicus Vile

time. Requires the use of either a Scrying Stone (exceedingly
artifacts), or a live animal/person to sacrifice. Knowledge of

a number of mages to keep their secrets safe from prying e

### Rite of Undeath
This ritual requires corpses, either skeletons or fresh corpses.
A corpse cannot be used if it was buried using the proper
burial rites of Arkay (a common practice used to ward against
Necromancy in some regions). This ritual is fairly common
amongst Necromancers, but widely forbidden by the various
peoples of Tamriel.
An undead creature raised using these Rites exists permanently
in Mundus until destroyed or otherwise vanquished. When
created, the necromancer must issue a single, simple order to
the undead. These are its Binding Words, and the undead is
considered to the bound to this task to the exception of all
others. The necromancer can make a +20 Necromancy test
as a Secondary Action to command their undead with a new
order, which the undead will attempt to fulfill before resuming
the duties of their Binding Words. An undead creature created
using these rituals counts as a Henchman.
The profane rituals of animating the dead are detailed here.
Different undead creatures require different components and
levels of expertise. Each of these creatures is considered a separate
ritual for the purposes of learning the rituals. All of these rituals
are a +20 Necromancy (Intelligence) test that, if failed, raises
the undead as uncontrolled revenants who immediately attack
the necromancer.
A Necromancer can repair any of their undead to full HP with
a simple 30 minute ritual using supplies worth a number of
drakes equal to the HP healed.
Bonewalker
Bonewalkers require 100 Magicka to raise, and require 30 minutes of ritual time. A bonewalker requires a fresh humanoid
corpse, and an additional humanoid skeleton. The skeleton’s
bones must be broken and embedded into the bonewalker in
a process that takes 4 hours, and the body must be washed
in sacred oils and ointments, which takes about an hour and
requires supplies that cost 100 drakes.
A bonewalker must be imbued with the sorceries it can cast,
and as a result must be charged with Paralzying magics. A
Bonewalker requires a Spell Level 5 or higher Paralyze spell to
be cast upon it before it is reanimated, at the end of the raising
ritual. If a Paralyze spell is not cast upon it, it cannot use it’s
Paralyzing Touch ability, nor can it use its Drain ability.

Bonelord
Bonelords require 300 Magicka to raise, and require 2 hour
ritual time. A Bonelord requires at least two humanoid skelet
and must have its limbs reinforced with metal spikes or lea
straps, which takes 2 hours to do, and requires 100 dra
worth of supplies.
Additionally, the Bonelord requires sacred inscriptions to
scrimshawed into its bones, which requires a +0 Lore test
the course of 6 hours. If this test fails, one of the skeleton
spoiled, and a new one must be used. A Bonelord mus

Bonewolf
Bonewolves require 50 Magicka to raise, and require 30 min
of ritual time. A bonewolf requires a wolf-sized skeleton, tho
it doesn’t neccessarily need to be a wolf. A large cat, hound
miscellanious bones lashed together in the general shape
wolf will do just fine. A bonewolf must have its limbs reinfo

Zombie
Zombies require 25 Magicka to raise, a relatively fresh corpse,
and 30 minutes of ritual time. A zombie must be properly
wrapped or embalmed, or will decay entirely within a week.
Embalming a zombie requires 6 hours of work and 25 drakes
worth of embalming supplies. This is, of course, entirely optional
should the necromancer decide it is not worth their time.
A character can raise multiple zombies at once, adding +10
Magicka and requiring a fresh corpse, embalmed or not, for
each additional zombie. Every five zombies added in this way
imposes a -10 on the Necromancy test to perform the ritual.
Dread Zombie
Dread Zombies require 100 Magicka to raise, and require 30
minutes of ritual time. A Dread Zombie must be properly
wrapped or embalmed, or will decay entirely within a week.
Embalming a Dread Zombie requires 6 hours of work and 50
drakes worth of embalming supplies. A Dread Zombie must also
be imbued with a Mysticism ingredient of at least Uncommon
quality, or else it will not infect targets with the Astral Vapours
disease.
### Rite of Necromantic Transcendence
This ritual allows a character to create a black soul gem. This
knowledge is rare, and only more experienced students of
Necromancy, who have accessed certain profane texts, might
know of it.
Creating a black soul gem requires waiting for the coordination
of the stars to shine their light on a pre-prepared necromantic altar. This profane starlight is known as the Shade of the
Revenant. Preparing the altar requires a Necromancy skill test
with a +10 bonus, and takes roughly six hours. The necromancer must then place an empty grand soul gem onto said
altar, and perform a five minute incantation, which requires
another Necromancy +10 skill test. At the culmination of the
incantation, the character must cast some form of Soul Trap
magic on the soul gem itself.
The time at which the Shade of the Revenant occurs is unknown
to most, but remains hidden in certain dark necromantic texts.
Determining the appropriate timing for the Necromancer’s
location requires a Lore skill test made at a -30 penalty, and
should only be possible if the character would have been exposed
to such texts. If everything is done correctly, the grand soul gem
will be transformed into a powerful black soul gem.

---

<!-- PDF page 28 | Rulebook p.152 -->
### Rite of Soul Sight
This ritual is a fairly simple Necromantic ritual that allow
character to peer into the mind of a black soul that the
captured within a soul gem. It takes minimal time, and a
Necromancy skill test opposed by a -10 Willpower test on
part of the target. On success the necromancer can read
mind of the captured soul. On failure, the ritual canno
reattempted for 7 days.
### Rite of Mortal Transference
This rite allows a character to extend their own life through
use of necromantic arts. Requires the fresh heart of a being w
a Black soul (man, mer, or beastfolk). Knowledge of this ritu
very uncommon, as it can only be found in obscure black t
This ritual can only be performed at night, and requires
character to magically prepare an altar. This requires a
Necromancy skill test. The GM should make this test for
character in secret, and note the results. The character m
also magically prepare a weapon (any weapon with the M
quality will do), and a ritual chalice worth 1500 drakes, b
of which require Necromancy skill tests.
Once this is complete, the character must place the hear
the altar, and strike it with a prepared weapon. The blood
remains on the weapon must be captured, every drop, i
the prepared chalice. If the character drinks the blood f
the chalice within five minutes, their natural lifespan wil
extended for 1d100 years. If the character is a Lich, this ri
will simply prevent decomposition for this time, and keep th
appearing alive.
If the character fails the initial Necromancy test, then the ritual
has gone wrong. Their lifespan is not extended. Roll a d5, and
then roll the result in d5s and combine the rolls. The character
ages (decomposes, for Liches) that many years instead.
Soulsnare
Allows a character to weave an aetherial net that seduces souls
from miles away. Whenever intelligent beings die within the net,
their passing thoughts are crafted into a lure, appealing to the
soul’s dim yearning towards the afterlife. Very few individuals
have ever known this rite, and fewer still could perform it, but
even Daedric Princes would bargain for such a trove.
The ritual requires a special altar fitted with an ornate Soul
Urn, a mysterious, priceless artefact that always necessitates
great sacrifice to obtain. Performing the ritual requires a -20
Necromancy skill test and twelve hours. On a successful test,
the Soulsnare extends across a number of kilometers equal to
fifty times the character’s degrees of success. Black souls who
die within this range are trapped within the Soul Urn, where
they swirl and clatter until transferred to a soul gem.
If characters wish to avoid being trapped in a Soulsnare, there are
some defensive options available. In most cases, staying true to
a divine being’s teachings, and performing all their sacraments,
will help guide one to the appropriate afterlife. Also, ground
can be consecrated to repel the net, thereby protecting the soul.
As a last resort, particularly skilled spiritual guides may be able
to reach out and direct a lost soul, but this would require a

## Alchemy
Alchemy is the mixing of ingredients, natural and unnatura
a way that produces a potion magically infused with a partic
effect. Alchemists take advantage of magicka stored within
ingredients in order to create potions that can replicate man
the same effects that can be achieved via spellcasting, or de
poisons to quickly bring their enemies to their knees.
Potions are one-use vials of alchemically prepared mixtu
created from alchemical ingredients, that can grant partic
magical effects to characters. A list of common potions is
vided in Chapter 7. Potions have an ENC of 0.
### Alchemical Ingredients
The potential power of any potion is limited by the stren
of the ingredients used to create it. Alchemical Ingredie
have three primary attributes: their school, strength, and de
The School of an ingredient determines which types of eff
it can be used to produce. For each effect a character wi
to include within a potion they must use an ingredient c
sponding to the school of that effect.
The Strength of an ingredient determines the amount of sto
magicka within it. The cost of the effect an alchemist wishe
create with those ingredients is limited by the strength of th
ingredients. Higher quality ingredients have higher stren
values, allowing for more powerful effects to be stored.
The Depth of an ingredient determines the complexity
power of effects it can be used to produce. Effects created w
this ingredient may not have a spell level above this value.
Ingredient Quality
Higher quality ingredients have higher Strength and Depth,
allowing for more powerful effects. The following table lists the
various quality levels and costs of alchemical ingredients of any
given type and their corresponding strength and depth values:
Alchemical Ingredients (any school)
Type Strength Depth Price
Ubiquitous 2 1 1
Plentiful 5 2 5
Common 10 3 10
Uncommon 15 4 35
Rare 25 5 100
Very Rare 50 6 250
Extremely Rare 100 7 500
Legendary 200 8 1000
Gathering Ingredients
Anyone with a cursory knowledge of Alchemy can identify
the most common ingredients, but more skilled alchemists
know where to look for higher quality ingredients. To search
for ingredients of any type, a character must make an Alchemy
skill test for every four hours they spend searching (a maximum
of 2 tests per day of downtime spent gathering). Compare
their degrees of success to the table below to determine what
they find. Characters may choose any school they wish for any
ingredients that they gather.
Ingredient Gathering (Quality)
DoS Maximum Result (any school)
8 Ubiquitious Ingredients OR
1-4 4 Plentiful Ingredients OR
2 Common Ingredients
5-6 1 Uncommon Ingredients
7 1 Rare Ingredient
8 1 Very Rare Ingredient
9 1 Extremely Rare Ingredient
10 1 Legendary Ingredient
A character may also choose to “downgrade” a result to a lower
roll. If a character rolls a critical success when gathering
ingredients, they count as having rolled the highest possible degrees of success for their target number plus one (for
example, 8 DoS for a TN 74).

### Creating Potions
This section contains the rules for creating potions. Alch
can only be performed if one has an Alchemy Lab, which
be found in Tools (page 181).
### The Basics
Unlike spells, potions do not have forms. Creating a po
is simply a matter of choosing the desired effects, setting
parameters of that effect to determine a final cost, and t
writing down the effects of the potion for reference.
Multi Effect Potions
Characters can create potions that impart multiple effects w
consumed. Creating these sorts of potions can prove m
difficult for the character but is not much more complica
than creating a normal potion.
Learning Effects
A character can use any effect from any school when crea
potions, but attempting to use effects of a higher level than
character’s rank in the Alchemy skill can be difficult.
Reference Materials
A complete list of effects can be found in the Appendix.
Step 1: Choose Ingredients
First, decide on which ingredients you will use for the potion.
Each ingredient included allows for a single effect to be added to
the potion, and no more than three ingredients (and thus three
effects, which must be unique) can be used in a single potion.
Step 2: Pick Effects & Determine Parameters
Next, pick the effect(s) (maximum 3) that the potion will
produce, and decide on their parameters. Only effects with
the potion attribute may be used.
The school(s) from which effects are chosen are limited to the
school and number of ingredients used in the potion (for example, one destruction and one alteration ingredient would allow
for one destruction and one alteration effect). Each effect has an
associated value, called spell level, that determines its strength.
The chosen spell level may not be higher than the depth of the
chosen ingredient.
Step 3: Determine Spell Cost
Next, simply “plug in” your chosen spell level values to the
effect cost formula provided for your chosen effect(s). If the
cost of an effect is higher than the strength of the corresponding
ingredient, then you must reduce the spell level of that effect
or use a stronger ingredient.
Step 4: Create Potion
To create a potion a character must pass an Alchemy skill test.
This test suffers a -10 penalty for each level by which the
potion’s highest spell level effect exceeds the Alchemy skill
rank of the character and an additional -10 for potions
with more than one effect. Creating a potion takes a number
of hours equal to the total of the spell levels of its effects, and
requires a set of alchemical tools. Ingredients are lost on failure.
Important Note:
It’s easy to miss, but calculating penalties for an Alchemy
test is distinct from that of a Spellcasting test. Here, there
is no concept of a Spellcasting Level; so, for example, a
Novice (0) level alchemist attempting to create a potion
with a level 1 spell effect will suffer a -10 penalty to their
Alchemy test.
If a character critically fails this test, or fails normally when
creating a potion that either includes multiple effects or an
effect with a level above their Alchemy skill rank, the potion
backfires. Roll a d4 on the creation backfire table and add the
highest spell level included in the potion to the result.

<!-- PDF page 31 | Rulebook p.155 -->
Step 5: Finalize Potion
Write down the details of the new potion’s effects somewh
you can reference it, and then add it to your character’s gear
Duration: If you choose an effect with the upkeep attrib
then the base duration of that effect is multiplied by an amo
equal to the strength of the effect’s ingredient divided by
cost of the effect (rounded down to the nearest whole num
Example: If the duration of an effect is normally 1 round, and
effect costs 3 magicka at the chosen spell level, then that effect wo
last for 3 rounds if created using an ingredient with a strength o
### Creating Poisons
Alchemists can also create poisons which can be applied
weapons in order to give one’s weapon an extra bite. This requ
a single unit of destruction ingredients, 1 hour, and an Alch
test to create. This test suffers a -10 penalty for each leve
which the poison exceeds the character’s Alchemy skill r
Poisons can be applied to weapons or ammo using the Re
Weapon action and last for 1 minute (10 rounds). Charac
who take damage from a poisoned weapon/ammo must m
an Endurance test or suffer poison damage that ignores ar
Poisons
Level Ingredients Used Damage
1 Ubiquitous 1d4
2 Plentiful 1d6
3 Common 1d8
4 Uncommon 1d10
5 Rare 1d12
6 Very Rare 2d8
7 Extremely Rare 2d10
8 Legendary 2d12
Toxins
Creating a poison with non-damaging effects, called a toxin,
does not follow the rules for normal poisons. They’re brewed
like a normal potion except only spell effects with the toxin
attribute can be used when brewing the toxin in question.
However, these more complicated compounds lose their bite
much more quickly than their simpler counterparts when
applied to weapons or ammo, lasting for 1 minute (10 rounds)
or 3 successful hits with the weapon/ammo, whichever comes
first.
Characters that take damage from a weapon poisoned with a
toxin use Endurance for any characteristic tests required by the
toxin’s magical effects.

them to, without fears of magical backfire. Well, eventually
he created that.”

## Enchanting
Enchanting is the act of endowing objects with magical p
erties through the use of the trapped energy of a soul wi
number of arcane rituals.
Souls & Soul Gems
Every being in the Elder Scrolls has a soul. The soul of a b
is their essence: it animates their physical being. There are
types of souls: black and white souls. Black Souls are the m
powerful souls of higher beings, such as men or mer. Wh
Souls are the souls of lesser beings, such as animals or Dae
Powering an enchantment with a soul first requires that the
be trapped within a Soul Gem, a naturally occurring mag
crystal. This is accomplished through the use of the Soul T
spell, which binds the target to a soul gem. If the target
while under this effect, their soul is captured within the
gem and converted to soul energy.
Soul Energy reflects the amount of magicka stored wit
the soul that can be used for enchanting. Once a soul g
has been filled with any amount of soul energy, it cannot h
any more added to it. Black souls always have a soul ene
of 1500, and using a Black Soul Gem in an enchantm
limits any associated Enchanting tests by the enchant
Necromancy Skill.
There are a number of different soul gems, each of which
its own maximum soul energy and can only hold certain ty
of souls. A soul may not be trapped within a soul gem wh
maximum soul energy is less than the soul energy of that s
Types of Soul Gems
Type Soul Types Max. Soul Energy Price
Petty White 100 25
Lesser White 250 100
Common White 500 250
Greater White 1000 1000
Grand White 1500 2500
Black Any 1500 5000
Item & Material Enchantment Level
The soul energy stored within a soul gem is not the only limiting
factor on the strength of an enchantment: different items can all
support enchantments of different strengths. Enchantable items
have an assigned Enchantment Level (EL), or the maximum
soul energy that may be used to enchant that item. Any excess
is simply ignored and lost at the end of the process.
Treat all items without a listed enchantment level as having an
EL of 10. See Chapter 7 for details.
Enchanting Weapons and Armor
Any weapon or piece of armor that is enchanted gains the Magic
Quality in addition to the listed effect of any enchantment
added to it.
Wearing Enchanted Gear
Any single character can only wear 1 enchanted item per hit
location (left/right arm, left/right leg, body, head) or 1 set of
clothes/robes, 1 necklace and 2 rings, and one wielded item
(weapon/shield) in each of their hands.
Spell Restraint and Spell Attributes
When applying or using spell effects on enchantments, Spell
Restraint, Overload, and Reinforce do not apply.
“Dangerous knowledge is still knowledge and therefore useful.
Usually turns out to be the most useful, in my experience.”
Mage Lord Neloth, Master of Sadrith Mora

Cast Enchantments
This section contains rules for using/creating cast enchantm
### The Basics
Cast enchantments are spells “stored” within an item. A cha
ter wielding such an item can invoke this magic through
use of the Cast Magic Primary Action, which allows them
cast the stored spell exactly as if they had cast it themse
(but with no casting test). The spell stored in the item can
either conventional or unconventional. Instead of being p
from the user’s magicka pool, the cost of the spell is drawn f
the item’s soul energy pool. Upkeep spells can be maintai
by paying their cost from this pool, but there can only
one upkeep spell effect from a single enchantment at a t
A cast enchantment’s Binding Strength represents how
the enchantment was woven: stronger enchantments are m
responsive to their users, and enable them to more easily sh
the spell to their will. The Binding Strength of the enchantm
is calculated when the enchantment is finalized in the last
of its creation.
When a spell is cast using a Cast Enchantment, the user cou
as having passed the casting test with a number of degree
success equal to the Binding Strength of the enchantment
Soul Energy Pool & Recharging
Cast enchantments do not last forever! Each cast with the i
pays its cost in soul energy from the item’s Soul Energy P
which is calculated when the enchantment is finalized in
last step of its creation. If this would reduce the size of the p
to below zero, then the enchantment can no longer be cast
must be recharged.
Recharging an item requires that the character be trained in
Enchant skill (though no test is required), and that they h
a soul gem with energy stored within it. A simple minute l
ritual is required: on completion the soul energy inside the
is transferred to the item’s pool. Any energy that would exc
the pool’s maximum size is lost and the gem is destroyed.
Multi-Spell Enchantments
Characters can create cast enchantments that have more t
one spell stored (to a maximum of 3). These enchantments
more difficult to create, and characters require the Manif
Enchanter (page 77) talent to attempt it. When used, th
function like normal cast enchantments, but the user sim
chooses which spell to cast and pays the appropriate soul en
cost from the item’s pool.
Learning Effects & Forms
A character does not need to know a particular spell in order to
imbue an item with it. Enchanters can also use any combination
of effects and forms availible during the spell making process,
and they do not need to be trained in a particular school to
use effects from that school. Note that using a spell with a level
above the character’s Enchant skill rank may be more difficult!
Mindlock
For enchantments with effects with the Mindlock attribute,
the AP cost must be paid by the wielder of the enchantment.
Conjure Weapon/Armor Enchantments
A summoned item of any type cannot take up the same space
as the Enchanted item previously did or the character risks the
binding magicks becoming unstable as the item phases in and
out of oblivion.
Likewise, should one enchanted item that is generating a Bound
item be replaced by another bound item, it will provoke the
same effect as the item fails spectacularly in a cascade-failure
of enchantments.
Mechanically, this means that should a summoned item coexist
on the same location as the enchanted item (an enchanted
chestpiece conjuring a bound one, or a character with boots
conjuring a bound chest plate on top of the chest plate generating a bound helmet), the character must roll a 1d100 at the
beginning of every Turn, on a result of 20 or lower, the character
takes a wound to that location instantly.
Reference Materials
A list of effects and forms can be found in the Appendix.
Follow these steps to imbue items with cast enchantments:
Step 1: Choose Item
First the enchanter must pick an item to enchant. Cast enchantments can be applied to any item, but only some items will have
an enchantment level high enough to reasonably support more
powerful enchantments. Items without a listed enchantment
level have an EL of 10.
Step 2: Choose Soul Gem
Next the enchanter must pick the soul gem they will use for
the enchantment. This gem must contain stored soul energy.
Once a soul gem has been used to create an enchantment, it is
destroyed and any excess energy is lost.
Step 3: Choose Enchantment Spell(s)
Cast enchantments can be used to store either conventional or
unconventional spells. In the case of conventional spells, simply
pick from the list in this chapter. Unconventional spells will

need to be built using the effects and forms provided in
appendix as normal (though the enchanter does not actu
need to spend the time or money to create the spell, and
test is needed).
Once the enchanter has chosen the spell they will use for
cast enchantment, note its spell level and casting cost for
next step. If the enchanter is imbuing multiple spells into
cast enchantment, note the details for each one.
Step 4: Create the Enchantment
Now the enchanter can attempt to create the enchantm
This requires a ritual that lasts approximately eight hours
consumes materials worth approximately 100 drakes.
The enchanter then makes an enchant skill test with a
penalty for each level by which the chosen spell level exce
their enchant skill rank (if applicable). Test again for
additional spells being added, if necessary. Failing a test me
that spell is not successfully enchanted.
Important Note:
It’s easy to miss, but calculating penalties for an
Enchanting test is distinct from that of a Spellcasting
test. Here, there is no concept of a Spellcasting Level; so,
for example, a Novice (0) level enchanter attempting to
create an enchantment with a level 1 spell effect will suffer
a -10 penalty to their Enchanting test.
Step 5: Finalize Enchantment
Regardless of the outcome of the tests, the soul gem is destroyed
and its energy is lost. If the enchanter passes a test, then they
successfully create the enchanted item. Write down the following
details somewhere you can reference them:
- S pells: Add the details of any spells included in the cast
enchantment, including their cost, spell level, and effects.
- B inding Strength: The binding strength of the enchantment is equal to the DoS of the Enchanting test or, on a
critical success, the maximum achievable DoS plus one.
- Soul Energy Pool Max: The item’s soul energy pool max is
equal to the soul energy in the gem, capped at the item’s EL.

Step 4: Create the Enchantment
Now the enchanter can attempt to create the enchantment.
This requires a ritual that lasts approximately eight hours and
consumes materials worth approximately 100 drakes.
The enchanter then makes an enchant skill test with a -10 penalty

Regardless of the outcome of the tests, the soul gem is destroyed
and its energy is lost. If the enchanter passes a test, then they
successfully create the enchanted item. Write down the details
somewhere you can reference them later.

If you want strike enchantments to function like cast
enchantments, divide the final cost by ten and use the

Constant Enchantments
This section contains rules for creating and using cons
enchantments.
### The Basics
Constant enchantments are passive enchantments that can
applied to any sort of item, and that constantly affect the we
or wielder of that item. In game terms, constant enchantme
apply their effects to the character wearing/wielding them
the start of each round (regardless of their normal durati
If the effect is dispelled, it returns to full functionality after
rounds. Constant enchantments do not need to be rechar
like cast enchantments and have no soul energy pool. The we
or wielder of a constant enchantment can willingly disabl
re-enable its effects at any time.
Learning Effects & Forms
A character may attempt to create a constant enchantm
using any effect from any school as long as that effect has
Upkeep Attribute and a listed duration. It is not dependen
their knowledge of any spells.
Multi Effect Enchantments
Characters can create constant enchantments that have m
than one effect (to a maximum of 3).These enchantments
more difficult to create, and characters require the Manif
Enchanter (page 77) talent to attempt it.
Reference Materials
A complete list of effects can be found in the Appendix.
Step 1: Choose Item
First the enchanter must pick an item to enchant. Cons
enchantments can be applied to any item, but only some it
will have an enchantment level high enough to reasona
support more powerful enchantments. Items without a li
enchantment level have an EL of 10.
Step 2: Choose Soul Gem
Next the enchanter must pick the soul gem they will use
the enchantment. This gem must contain stored soul en
Once a soul gem has been used to create an enchantment,
destroyed and any excess energy is lost.
Step 3: Choose Constant Effect(s)
Constant enchantments are not created using the normal s
making rules. Instead, the enchanter simply picks the effe
they want and compares the combined spell level(s) of t
chosen effects to the table below.
Soul Energy and Enchant Levels
Total Spell Level(s) Minimum Soul Energy
1 500
2 600
3 800
4 1000
5 1200
6 1400
7+ 1500
The chosen effects must have the upkeep attribute, and must
have a specific listed duration.
The Become Ethereal effect or any effects from the
Conjuration or Necromancy cannot be chosen.
If the soul gem has enough energy to power the enchantment,
then they can attempt to create it; otherwise it is impossible as
the enchantment cannot sustain itself on so little energy.
Step 4: Create the Enchantment
Now the enchanter can attempt to create the enchantment.
This requires a ritual that lasts approximately eight hours and
consumes materials worth approximately 100 drakes.
The enchanter then makes an enchant skill test with a -10 penalty
for each level by which the total level of the chosen effect(s)
exceeds their enchant skill rank (if applicable).
Step 5: Finalize Enchantment
Regardless of the outcome of the tests, the soul gem is destroyed
and its energy is lost. If the enchanter passes a test, then they
successfully create the enchanted item. Be sure to write down
the effect(s) of the enchantment for reference.
Optional Rule - Cursed Constant Enchantments
Some groups may like the idea of Cursed Enchantments.
If you’re using this optional rule, then the following Spell
Effect can also be added to an enchantment:
Name: Curse
Rules: This enchantment cannot be disabled by its
wearer. To remove the enchanted item, the wearer can test
Willpower immediately after equipping it, removing the
item on a success.
After the initial equipping, the SL determines the
frequency at which the test can be retried:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
1/min 1/hr 1/day 1/wk 1/mth 1/yr never
This effect can only be applied to Constant Enchantments.

### Spell Scrolls
Spell scrolls are another form of magic item that can be cre
with enchanting. Spell scrolls are a hybrid of the spellcas
and enchanting arts, allowing mages to store their spells in
easily accessible form: a scroll enchanted with magic runes
reproduce the effect of the spell when read.
### The Basics
Spell scrolls are single use items that a character can activat
using the Cast Magic action. This allows them to cast the sto
spell at no magicka cost automatically: they count as hav
passed the casting test with a number of degrees of success e
to the Binding Strength of the scroll. This represents h
effectively the magic of the spell was imprinted on the sc
The scroll reproduces the effects of the spell exactly as deci
by the creator, including whether or not the spell is overloa
or extended via upkeep (if applicable).
Learning Spells
A character can only create a spell scroll for a conventiona
unconventional spell that they themselves know. Using a s
with a level higher than the character’s enchant skill rank
be difficult.
Follow these steps to create a spell scroll:
Step 1: Gather Materials
Creating a spell scroll consumes materials worth approximately
25 drakes and an hour long ritual.
Step 2: Create Spell Scroll
The character picks one of the spells they know and makes an
enchant skill test penalized by -10 for each level by which the
spell level exceeds their enchant skill rank. They must pay the
cost of the spell as if they had cast it, either from their own
magicka pool or by subtracting the cost from the soul energy of
a soul gem in their possession (this does not destroy the gem).
The character must choose if they wish to overload the spell
(use their Willpower bonus for the scroll’s effect) or extend the
duration via upkeep, if applicable, and must pay the appropriate
associated costs.
Step 3: Finalize Scroll
On success, the character creates the spell scroll. The binding strength of the enchantment is equal to the DoS of the
Enchanting test. Write down the effects of the spell somewhere
you can reference it, and add the scroll to the character’s gear list.
