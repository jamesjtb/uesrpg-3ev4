As is true for most roleplaying games, the goal of the Unofficial Elder Scrolls RPG is to provide a framework for game masters and players to craft and enjoy characters, stories and adventures in the Elder Scrolls setting. In order to achieve this, a flexible set of core mechanics are needed, something capable of handling a number of different scenarios with ease. This Chapter will introduce you to these core mechanics, as well as the basic concepts necessary to understand the rest of the game.

## The Two Golden Rules

This book contains quite a few rules, and it’s easy for one to get lost, especially if one isn’t used to role-playing games of this type. In other cases, certain rules might not fit well with the way your group prefers to play. Both of these cases can slow down, or otherwise harm, the gaming experience for a group.

To combat this, keep in mind these two golden rules above all others. First, if a certain rule is slowing play down too much, just stop using it. Second, if you want to change something, do it. While we have done our best to provide a ruleset that should be acceptable, nobody knows what works for your group better than you do.

## Core Mechanics

The goal of most people who play role-playing games is to experience exciting, stressful, or dramatic situations in another world or time through the eyes of their character. Invariably, the players will want to know how well their characters perform certain actions in these situations. They do this by making tests.

### Making Tests

A Test is a d100 roll made to determine whether or not a character has succeeded or failed at a certain action, and to what degree. Characters will be called to make tests in a variety of scenarios, but it’s important to remember that tests are not required for every action. There’s no need to make a test to have your character take a few steps across a room. If, on the other hand, you find your character forced to walk across a tightrope suspended above a lake of molten lava in order to escape angry Dremora (or something equally dramatic), then you will probably want to know if your character manages to cross in time. It is recommended that the GM only require tests if one or more of the following conditions hold true:

- The activity is unusual for the character, and not something they attempt routinely.
- The character is lacking the time and/or tools necessary to complete the task.
- The circumstances and environment impose stress.
- There are meaningful consequences for failing the action.

You make tests by making a percentile roll and comparing the result to a Target Number, often referred to as TN, and typically a value between 1 and 100. If the roll is less than or equal to the target number, the character succeeds. If the roll is higher than the target number, they fail.

**Example:** A character is attempting a very difficult task at which they are relatively skilled. After accounting for modifiers, they determine that their target number for the test is 37. They manage to roll a 32, below their target number, so they succeed!

### Degrees of Success and Failure

Sometimes knowing whether or not your character succeeded a test isn’t enough. Each successful test or failed test also produces a number that represents how well or how poorly that character succeeded on the task they were attempting.

It is not necessary to calculate degrees on most tests, but certain tests (such as attack and defense rolls) require it, and it can also be useful if the GM wants a measure of roughly how strongly a character succeeded or failed.

A character’s **Degrees of Success (DoS)** on a test is equal to the 10’s digit (the first number) of the result of their d100 roll. A character always achieves at least one degree of success if they pass a test, even if they roll a single digit result.

**Example:** A character succeeds on a test with a target number of 47, and they rolled a 32, so they achieved three degrees of success. If the same character were to pass that same test with any roll ranging from 40 to 47, then they would achieve four degrees of success instead.

A character’s **Degrees of Failure (DoF)** on a test is equal to one plus the tens digit of the difference between the result of their d100 roll and their target number. A character always fails with at least one degree of success if they fail a test.

**Example:** A character fails on a test with a target number of 57, and they rolled a 72. So, they failed with two degrees of failure.

As characters improve their target numbers for common tasks by increasing their skills, then higher and higher degrees of success naturally become possible for them. A character with a Target Number over 100 adds the 10s digit of their Target Number to their DoS.

### Difficulty & Modifiers

Not all tests are created equal! Modifiers are adjustments made to a test’s target number (not the roll itself), that make the test easier or harder for a character to pass. Bonuses are modifiers that increase the target number and thus make success more likely, while Penalties are modifiers that decrease the target number and thus make success less likely. If a test would be subject to more than one modifier, simply add their values together to determine the net modifier for that test.

The Difficulty of a test is a modifier applied based on how much more difficult or easy the test becomes due to circumstance.

One of the most important jobs of the GM is to determine the difficulty of tests. The test difficulty table below provides guidelines for recommended modifiers given particular levels of difficulty.

Once the difficulty has been decided, apply the modifier to the test’s target number and roll the test against the modified target number. GMs who desire more finesse should not be afraid to assign test difficulty in increments of +/- 5.

**Example:** A character attempts to break down a wooden door in a dungeon. The GM decides that this task would be relatively easy compared to breaking down a normal door, as the wood is aged and rotting, and so assigns a difficulty of Easy to this test. They also tell the player which Characteristic or Skill to use to determine the target number (more on this in the Characteristic & Skill Tests section). When making the test, the player would increase their normal target number by 20.

#### Test Difficulty Levels

| Difficulty | Modifier |
|---|---:|
| Effortless | +40 |
| Simple | +30 |
| Easy | +20 |
| Ordinary | +10 |
| Average | +0 |
| Challenging | -10 |
| Difficult | -20 |
| Hard | -30 |
| Very Hard | -40 |

Note that the GM should feel free to impose modifiers on tests beyond +/- 40 if it would be appropriate for the situation. This range is not meant to be limiting, it simply reflects the most common difficulty levels that will likely see use in an average campaign.

### Critical Successes & Failures

Sometimes a character succeeds or fails a test in particularly spectacular ways. Such dramatic successes, or abysmal failures, are referred to as Critical Successes or Critical Failures.

A character’s chance of rolling a critical success depends on their five Lucky and Unlucky numbers. A character has a number of Lucky Numbers equal to their Luck Bonus (a concept we will explore in Defining a Character), and a number of Unlucky Numbers equal to five minus their Luck bonus. These numbers are chosen randomly at character creation.

**Example:** a character with a Luck bonus of 3 might have 7, 63, and 89 as their Lucky Numbers, and 16 and 44 as their Unlucky Numbers.

If a character rolls one of their Lucky Numbers then the test is considered a critical success (regardless of the target number). On the flip side, if the character rolls one of their Unlucky Numbers then the test is a critical failure (regardless of the target number).

A critical success is a dramatic, stunning success. GMs should reward characters with circumstantially appropriate effects whenever they roll critical successes. Though in the case of particularly difficult (or nigh impossible) tests, a critical success might simply represent the fact that the character managed to succeed “normally” against all odds.

A critical failure is an abysmal, terrible failure. GMs should punish characters with circumstantially appropriate effects whenever they roll critical failures. Though in the case of particularly easy tests, a critical failure might simply represent the fact that the character managed to fail “normally” despite all of their advantages.

In combat, critical successes and failures have specific effects for attack and defense rolls that are further explained in the appropriate section.

#### Non-Player Character (NPC) Criticals

Creatures and NPCs do not have Luck like a Player Character does; however, they still have the capacity to critically succeed or fail. Unless specified on the statblock, use the following rules:

- On a roll of 1-3, the roll is considered a Critical Success.
- On a roll of 98-100, the roll is considered a Critical Failure.

## Types of Tests

You won’t always be testing your character in the same way every session. There are four different types of tests that a character can be called to make, each reflecting a different circumstance.

### Standard Tests

Tests without any opposition are known as Standard Tests. They measure how well a character performs an action in a particular situation. Standard tests are handled as described on the previous page: a result less than or equal to the modified target number is a success, and a result above the target number is a failure. The GM can call for the character to calculate their degrees of success on the roll if it is required by the test, or if they just want to have that additional metric.

### Teamwork

Two or more characters can work together on a single task. The character leading the effort is the one who makes the actual test, and as long as having someone to assist them would be productive then they may reroll the test once if they fail initially. The helper(s) do not need to be trained in the skill being used as long as the GM decides that they can follow directions or make themselves useful in some other way.

### Group Test

Sometimes the GM may call for multiple characters to attempt to accomplish a task where each member of the group is expected to perform. In these cases the characters who are more skilled can help cover for their comrades. To make a group test, everyone in the group rolls the same test with the same modifiers. If at least half of the group succeeds, then the whole group does. Otherwise the group fails. This can be used to represent things like a group of characters attempting to navigate dangerous terrain or avoid detection by enemies.

### Simple Tests

In many circumstances there is no chance that a character will fail a particular action, but the GM wants a simple gauge of how well the character performs. In this case, a Simple Test may be employed. This is handled just like a standard test, but rather than determining success or failure, the result of the test determines whether the character succeeds strongly (passes the test) or succeeds weakly (fails the test).

### Opposed Tests

Whenever a character’s action is directly opposed by that of another character, the GM can call for an Opposed Test. Both characters make a test against each other, with the result determining the winner. To make an opposed test, each character rolls a standard test as appropriate to the situation. If only one of the characters succeeds, that character wins. If both succeed, then the characters have tied. If both fail, then nobody wins.

Note that both characters do not have to actually roll the same test: characters making different tests for different actions can still be acting in opposition to one another.

Opposed tests that result in a tie (both characters succeed) are typically broken by comparing degrees of success, with the character who has the greater success being the winner. Further ties can be broken by having the characters reroll. Sometimes the GM may rule that the test has simply resulted in a tie and the two characters remain locked against each other until one of them gives up or another opposed test is made.

If a character rolls a critical success during an opposed test, they automatically win the contest regardless of their opponent’s degrees of success (unless both rolled a critical success, in which case the tie is broken by a roll off).

### Extended Tests

Sometimes the GM may rule that a single task may require more than one test to achieve. An extended test is simply a series of one or more tests made by a character where each successful test adds to the character’s total degrees of success. Once their total reaches a threshold decided by the GM, they pass the test. This can be used to simulate tasks like breaking down a door.

Most extended tests are also performed under some sort of time pressure. With infinite time it is assumed the character could eventually complete the task. However, if the task has a time limit, then “failure” is simply represented by not achieving success in the allotted time.

**Example:** An Imperial soldier is attempting to bash down a door to help their comrade on the other side who is beset by foes. The GM rules that this requires an extended test and that each Turn the soldier can make a Strength test to attempt to damage the door. The GM has decided that 10 degrees of success are necessary to overcome the door. On their first Turn the soldier succeeds with 5 degrees. On their second, they fail. On their first Turn of the second round they succeed with 3 degrees. And on their second Turn of the second round, they succeed with 4 degrees and finally smash the door down. Fortunately their ally is still alive, and at the start of the third round the soldier draws their sword and rushes into the room...

## Characteristic & Skill Tests

Until now, we have simplified the concept of tests. Characters are largely defined by their characteristics, which provide the base target number for almost all tests. Characters also have skills, which can affect different tests in certain circumstances. All tests (regardless of the test’s type) can be divided into two categories based on whether a characteristic or a skill is used to determine the target number.

**Characteristic Tests** are tests made with a target number based on one of a character’s characteristic scores and modified as appropriate for the difficulty of the test. These tests are used when a character is performing a task that does not require or benefit from specialized training and relies only on their natural abilities.

**Skill Tests** are tests made with a target number based on one of a character’s characteristic scores and their relevant skill level. Like characteristic tests, skill tests are also modified as appropriate for the difficulty of the test; unlike characteristic tests, skill tests also take into account a character’s skill at whatever task they are attempting. Skill tests are used when a task requires some form of specialized training or skill to perform well.

Each skill has an associated set of governing characteristics (listed in parenthesis next to the skill, typically) which are the characteristics upon which that skill relies. Typically the player chooses which characteristic to use, but the GM may require that they must use a particular one if they feel the circumstances dictate it.

Once the governing characteristic has been determined, add the character’s skill bonus (equal to ten times their skill rank) and any other applicable modifiers to the characteristic score. If a character instead has no training in the skill, they suffer a -20 penalty in addition to any other applicable modifiers. This value is the target number for the skill test.

**Example:** A thief attempts to leap delicately between two rooftops. The GM rules this requires an Acrobatics test of Challenging difficulty (-10). The thief has the Acrobatics (Str, Ag) skill trained to the Journeyman rank (+20). The player chooses Agility as the base characteristic for the test as it is higher than their Strength and better fits the task at hand. They apply a net +10 modifier to their Agility score of 43. They then roll a 37, which is a success (with 3 degrees) against their target number of 53.

### Limited Skill Tests

In some circumstances the GM may rule that a character’s skill in one area is limited by their lack of skill in another. For example, a character fighting while balancing on a moving surface is limited by their ability to balance themself properly. In these cases the character may not take advantage of any of their ranks in the primary skill that would exceed their ranks in the limiting one.

**Example:** A smuggler is dueling with a pirate on the deck of a ship on the high seas. The ship is rocking heavily in the waves, and unfortunately for the smuggler they are not able to balance themselves well enough to fight to their full potential in this environment. Their Combat Style skill, normally rank 3 (+30), is treated as being rank 1 (+10) because that is their Acrobatics skill rank.

## Defining a Character

In game terms, a character is simply a collection of statistics and other information that help define and accurately represent a being in the Elder Scrolls setting. This same system is also used to define the various people, monsters, and other beings that populate the setting. From this point forward, the player characters will be referred to as PCs, while non-player characters will be referred to as NPCs. Even monsters and other creatures are classified as characters! Characters, particularly PCs, can be divided into two main parts: the character concept and the character profile.

### Character Concept

A character concept simply defines who the character is within the context of the game setting. This can range from a simple idea in a player’s head (a dashing rogue who fights with a rapier!) to an in depth back-story written before the game begins. However extensive it may be, all characters should have a basic concept associated with them, even the NPCs that the GM creates for the party to interact with.

### Character Profile

A character profile defines who the character is within the context of the game rules, providing a suite of stats which can be used to resolve a variety of dramatic scenarios in which the character may find themselves. These values are the focus of the majority of the rules in this book, and will be the focus of the rest of this section as well.

Each character profile is made up of the following elements:

- **Characteristics:** Eight values that represent the broad physical and mental capabilities of the character.
- **Attributes:** Derived statistics that represent more specific measurements of a character capabilities and their current resources.
- **Skills:** A set of categories and associated ranks that reflect a character’s ability to perform certain actions.
- **Talents:** A set of unique abilities the character has come to possess through training or experience.
- **Traits:** Rules that reflect inherent physical facts about the character, certain abilities they naturally possess, or particular features of their personality.
- **Magic:** The set of all magical abilities the character possesses.

The primary means by which characters progress is through the accumulation and use of Experience Points (XP) awarded by the GM. XP can be spent by the players between game sessions in order to improve or change their character’s profile in a number of ways.

## Characteristics

The eight Characteristics are values that define the broad physical and mental capabilities of each character. Characteristics have two pieces of information associated with them: the characteristic score, and the characteristic bonus.

A Characteristic’s Score is a numerical value representing that specific Characteristic. It has a minimum of zero, but there is no upper limit on its value. The scores tend to hover in the 35-45 range on average. Higher values are better. A given characteristic’s Bonus is a value equal to the tens digit of the associated characteristic score and is used for certain calculations where the full score is too large.

Below is a list of all the characteristics that define a character, how they are abbreviated, and what they each represent:

- **Strength (Str / SB):** physical prowess and ability to push physical limits.
- **Endurance (End / EB):** physical health, stamina, toughness, resistance to damage.
- **Agility (Ag / AB):** speed, reflexes, coordination; moving quickly and gracefully.
- **Intelligence (Int / IB):** problem solving, reasoning, recall, understanding of magicka.
- **Willpower (Wp / WB):** mental control, resilience; ability to control and shape magicka.
- **Perception (Prc / PcB):** physical awareness; accuracy of “gut instincts” and intuition.
- **Personality (Prs / PsB):** charisma, presence, expressiveness, social abilities.
- **Luck (Lck / LB):** good fortune and how often events go a character’s way. (See Luck in Chapter 5.)

### Favored Characteristics

Not all characteristics are created equal! Some characters excel in certain areas over others, beyond a simple difference in raw characteristic score. Favored Characteristics are those characteristics a character is naturally gifted in; improving those characteristics, or skills and abilities associated with them (including specializations), is easier than usual.

Each PC has two favored characteristics. Advancing or learning skills or talents governed by a favored characteristic, or advancing that characteristic, costs 75% of the usual XP cost (round down to the nearest multiple of 5).

## Attributes

A character’s Attributes are statistics derived from a character’s characteristics that represent more specific measurements of a character’s capabilities. While characteristics reflect general aptitude in a certain area, attributes measure specific values with very precise meanings used for particular game mechanics.

- **Health Points (Endurance / 2):** HP maximum is half Endurance (round up). Damage reduces current HP. (See Physical Health in Chapter 5.)
- **Wound Threshold (EB + SB + WB):** WT equals Endurance + Strength + Willpower bonuses. (See Physical Health in Chapter 5.)

> Optional Rule Note: Alternate Wounds  
> If you’re using the rules for Alternate Wounds found in Physical Health later in Chapter 5, then your character will not have a Wound Threshold Attribute.

- **Stamina Points (Endurance Bonus):** SP maximum equals Endurance bonus (modified in other ways). Below 0 SP: gain fatigue. (See Physical Health in Chapter 5.)
- **Magicka Points (Intelligence):** MP maximum equals Intelligence score. (See Chapter 6: Magic.)

### Linguistics (IB - 2, to a maximum of 4)

A character’s Linguistics is equal to their Intelligence bonus minus two to a maximum of four and reflects the maximum number languages that they can start with at character creation. Every character starts with Cyrodilic, which is the common tongue around Tamriel and doesn’t count as one of the languages known from this attribute. One Exotic language counts as 2 languages known. Players should check in with their GM if they choose from the list of Exotic Languages. Additionally, GMs may expand this list of languages to fit setting of their game.

#### Languages

| Common Race | Language | Exotic Race | Language |
|---|---|---|---|
| Imperial | Cyrodilic | Dwemer | Dwemeris |
| Khajiit | Ta’Agra | Falmer | Falmer |
| Nord | Nordic | Daedra | Daedric |
| Altmer | Aldmeri | Ayleid | Ayleidoon |
| Argonian | Jel | Dragon | Dovahzul |
| Dunmer | Dunmeri | Ehlnofey | Ehlnofex |
| Redguard | Yoku | Akavir | Akaviri |
| Bosmer | Bosmeri | Reachfolk | Reach-tongue |
| Breton | Bretic |  |  |
| Orsimer | Orcish |  |  |

**Important Note: Languages and Your Character**  
Of all of the Attributes, Linguistics is the most malleable. Think about this formula and chart as a starting point; if what you end up with needs some tweaking to fit the idea you have for your character, consider discussing your ideas with your GM.

Throughout the course of the game, Characters that wish to pursue learning languages can do so. Please discuss with your GM on ways to do this.

- **Initiative Rating (AB + IB + PcB):** used for initiative rolls. (See Combat, page 97.)
- **Size Category:** Standard by default; affects physical size. (See Movement & Size in Chapter 5.)
- **Speed (SB + [2 x AB]):** movement budget per combat round. (See Movement & Size in Chapter 5.)
- **Carry Rating ([4 x SB] + [2 x EB]):** measure of weight carry/lift/push. (See Items & Encumbrance.)
- **Action Points:** maximum AP is 3; spent AP regenerates each round.
- **Luck Points (LB):** LP maximum equals Luck Bonus; refresh at start of each session. (See Luck.)
- **Lucky/Unlucky Numbers:** Lucky count equals Luck bonus; Unlucky count equals five minus Luck bonus. (See Critical Successes & Failures.)
- **Experience Points:** current XP is spent on advancements. (See Character Advancement.)

## Skills

A character’s Skills are a set of categories and associated ranks that reflect a character’s ability to perform certain actions. The ranks reflect the character’s experience, training, and overall ability to perform these various actions. Skills are either trained or untrained. Each trained skill has a corresponding Skill Rank, which has an associated value from 0 to 5, which reflects how capable the character is at utilizing that skill. Each skill has one or more Governing Characteristics: a set of characteristics that reflect the different ways that a character can utilize a single skill.

### Skill List

| Skill | Governing Characteristics |
|---|---|
| Acrobatics | Strength, Agility |
| Alchemy | Intelligence |
| Alteration | Willpower |
| Athletics | Strength, Endurance |
| Combat Style [Field] | Strength, Agility |
| Command | Strength, Intelligence, Personality |
| Commerce | Intelligence, Personality |
| Conjuration | Willpower |
| Deceive | Intelligence, Personality |
| Destruction | Willpower |
| Enchant | Intelligence |
| Evade | Agility |
| Illusion | Willpower |
| Investigate | Intelligence, Perception |
| Logic | Intelligence, Perception |
| Lore | Intelligence |
| Mysticism | Willpower |
| Navigate | Intelligence, Perception |
| Necromancy | Intelligence |
| Observe | Perception |
| Persuade | Strength, Personality |
| Profession [Field] | (Varies) |
| Restoration | Willpower |
| Ride | Agility |
| Stealth | Agility, Perception |
| Subterfuge | Agility, Intelligence |
| Survival | Intelligence, Perception |

### Skill Ranks

| Skill Rank | Value | Bonus | Equivalence |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Untrained | — | -20 | No knowledge. |
| Novice | 0 | +0 | Rudimentary knowledge. |
| Apprentice | 1 | +10 | Basic proficiency. |
| Journeyman | 2 | +20 | Hands on experience and/or some professional training. |
| Adept | 3 | +30 | Extensive experience or training. |
| Expert | 4 | +40 | Professional level ability. |
| Master | 5 | +50 | Complete mastery. |

When a character makes a skill test, they apply a bonus equal to +10 times the value of their skill rank (starting at +0 for novice [rank 0], and up to +50 at master [rank 5]) to the base characteristic. Typically the player chooses which characteristic to use as the base, but the GM may require that they must use a particular characteristic if they feel the circumstances dictate it. If a character attempts to use a skill that is untrained instead of trained, the test suffers a -20 penalty instead.

### Specializations

Trained skills can also have accompanying Specializations, which represent areas of concentration and focus in a character’s training and experience with that skill. A character may take as many specializations as their rank in a given skill. When making a skill test in the listed area of specialization, the character gains a +10 bonus to the test. A character may not benefit from more than one specialization bonus on a single test.

For more information on skills, see Chapter 3.

## Talents

A character’s Talents are the various unique abilities the character has come to possess through training or experience. They include everything from passive bonuses to activated abilities, and can even modify how the character uses certain skills. For more information see Chapter 4: Talents & Traits.

## Traits

A character’s Traits are rules that reflect various natural facts about the character or certain abilities they possess. They include things such as the ability to fly, inherent physical weaknesses, personality traits, and so forth. For information, see Traits in Chapter 4.

## Magic

A character’s magic encompasses the spells, rituals, powers, and other magical abilities they possess. For information, see Chapter 6.

## Stamina

Stamina is a unique attribute compared to HP or MP in that it represents the character’s ability to push their physical limits and can be spent for a variety of effects. Stamina is what allows characters to trek for multiple kilometers through difficult terrain, land killing blows, and push themselves to new heights of physical strength and endurance. A character’s Stamina is represented primarily by their Stamina Points, which measure how often they can push their limits in this fashion.

### Stamina Points

A character’s Stamina Point (SP) maximum is equal to their Endurance bonus, though it may be modified in other ways. When a character is below zero SP they have a level of fatigue for each point of Stamina below zero.

A character may still spend or lose SP even if they have none remaining, but each time they do so they gain a level of fatigue. This can cause them to eventually exhaust themself and fall unconscious.

### Regaining SP

A character regains an amount of SP equal to their Endurance bonus after a long rest and regains only 1 SP after a short rest (or removes a level of fatigue).

### Spending Stamina

A character can choose to spend SP in exchange for a number of effects, though going below 0 SP causes the character to gain a level of fatigue. Characters may spend Stamina for the following effects, but they cannot spend it for more than one effect per character Turn. A character cannot use both Luck and SP to modify the result of a single test:

- **Physical Exertion** (1 SP, spend before test): Gain a +20 bonus on the next Strength or Endurance based skill or characteristic test (except for Combat Style skill tests).
- **Sprint** (1 SP, spend before moving): Modify the character’s Dash action to allow them to move up to twice their speed.
- **Power Draw** (1 SP): The character reduces the reload time for the next shot with their current weapon by 1. Reload 0 means the reload is free unless the weapon has a minimum.
- **Power Attack** (1-3 SP, spend before damage roll): Increase the damage of a melee or ranged damage roll by twice the stamina points spent to a maximum of 3 for +6 damage.
- **Power Block** (1 SP, spend after damage roll): The character doubles the BR of their shield for the purposes of resolving a block. This only modifies the BR of the shield against physical damage, not magical damage types.
- **Heroic Action** (1 SP): The character regains a spent AP. This may only be done once per round.

## Luck

Luck is unique amongst the other characteristics in that it represents something more abstract than a character’s physical strength or mental resilience. Luck reflects the tendency of events to work out in a character’s favor. This can seem to represent nothing more than coincidence or good fortune, but destiny and fate play a role as well.

Because Luck governs no skills, a character will not be called upon to test it as often as they might for another characteristic. Luck is used in several ways: it determines a character’s chance of critical success or failure (as detailed earlier in this chapter), they can spend Luck points for certain benefits, they can attempt Luck tests in certain circumstances, and they can burn Luck permanently in exchange for a number of powerful effects. Characters cannot advance Luck at any time.

### Spending Luck Points

Each session a character is afforded a number of Luck points (or LP, see Defining a Character in this chapter). A character’s LP max is equal to their Luck bonus, and they begin each new game session with this many LP available to them.

Characters may spend these luck points in order to influence their character’s fate:

- Characters may spend a Luck point whenever they fail a test. If they do so, the character may immediately reroll that failed test. This may only be done once for a given test, and cannot be used to reroll Critical Failures.
- Characters may spend a Luck point to add a degree of success to a successful test (including one passed using spent Luck points). This can be done multiple times for a given test. Once a character has used all of their LP for a given session, they can resort to burning luck (see below).
- Characters may spend a Luck point in order to modify the narrative in some way, such as retroactively “remembering” to purchase something that would be helpful for the party.

### Luck Tests

In certain situations the GM can call upon the character to make a Luck test in scenarios when they need to determine whether or not some random event happens to work in the character’s favor. For example, if a character is knocking on doors during the night trying to find someone to help them, the GM could have the character make a Luck roll to determine if someone happens to be at awake to hear them. These tests function just like any other characteristic test.

> Optional Rule: Goal-Oriented Luck Points Refreshing  
> Some groups may find refreshing Luck Points at the start of each session to be too frequent or stale. For these groups, we recommend an optional rule: characters start with 1 LP after character creation and only gain LP by earning them through character and party moments. These might include adhering to a character’s Bonds, flaws, and personality traits; good planning; positive interactions with deities; achieving character or party goals; and other moments or interactions the GM deems appropriate.  
>  
> GMs new to the system or their group should reward players with LP often until they have a good idea of how the system and players use them. This rule adds more weight to character moments and can help make LP feel like a more meaningful resource, rather than a constant refreshment.

### Burning Luck

The player characters are the heroes of the story, and fortune favors heroes! Characters may choose to permanently reduce their Luck characteristic score by one or more points in order to benefit from a number of different effects. This is known as Burning Luck.

Luck that a character burns never regenerates naturally. A character may burn any amount of Luck at any time.

Characters may burn Luck for the following effects. If they do not have the required amount, simply burn all remaining Luck:

- **Burn 1 Luck:** Add a degree of success to a successful test. This can be done multiple times for a given test.
- **Burn 3 Luck:** Reroll a failed test. This may only be done once for a given test. This cannot be used to reroll Critical Failures.
- **Burn 5 Luck:** Negate the effects of a critical failure. This must be done immediately after the test is rolled.
- **Burn 10 Luck:** Ignore the effects of a wound (though they still take the damage). Alternatively, and with GM permission, this can be used to allow a character to survive death at great cost (they are removed from play until the end of the encounter instead). Some GMs may not want players to have the ability to extend the life of a character this way, depending on the tone of a campaign.

## Rest & Travel

This section describes the rules for how characters can recover when resting and how to handle travel across long distances.

### Rest

During their adventures characters will often spend long periods of time in dangerous environments and situations, and will typically need some time to recover afterwards. One way to do that is by resting. There are two different types of rests: long rests and short rests.

#### Long Rests

A long rest is an 8 hour long period of downtime in which the character performs no strenuous physical activity.

At the end of a long rest, a character removes a number of levels of fatigue/regains SP (assuming all fatigue is removed first) equal to their Endurance bonus, heals an amount of Health Points equal to their Endurance bonus (as long as they have no untreated wounds), and regenerates all of their missing Magicka Points. Many powers also recharge at the end of a long rest.

Their natural healing is doubled if the character is focused entirely on healing themselves or if another person is caring for them.

A character cannot benefit from more than one long rest in a 24 hour period and must be conscious at the start to gain its benefits.

#### Short Rests

A short rest is an hour long period of downtime in which the character performs no strenuous physical activity. At the end of a short rest, a character regenerates one Stamina Point or removes one level of fatigue. Additionally, they recover a number of Magicka Points determined by dropping the ones place from their Maximum MP. So, if a character’s Maximum Magicka is 56, they recover 5 Magicka.

GMs should exercise common sense in determining how frequently the party takes a Short Rest in any given day.

### Travel

Adventurers are often wanderers, traveling far across Tamriel in search of fame and fortune.

#### Travel Pace

A character, or group of characters, can travel at either a slow, normal, or fast pace. This determines how far they can move in a given period of time and how taxing the journey is. Characters traveling through particularly difficult terrain travel at half the normal speed for their given pace.

| Pace | Speed | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Fast | 7 kph / 56 km/day | -20 to Observe |
| Normal | 5 kph / 40 km/day | — |
| Slow | 3 kph / 24 km/day | Can move stealthily |

#### Travel and Exhaustion

The travel pace assumes that characters travel roughly 8 hours in a day. For each hour traveled beyond this the characters must make an Endurance test, starting at +0 for the first hour, with a stacking -10 penalty for each subsequent hour. On failure, the character loses 1 SP.

## Items & Encumbrance

Encumbrance represents the mass and bulk of the items the character is wearing, wielding, or carrying on their person. The Encumbrance Value (ENC) of an item is a single digit number that represents this. Items with an ENC of zero are, on their own, inconsequential. But if a character is carrying a large number of these items, treat every 10 zero ENC items as having a total ENC of one.

Containers like the sack, backpack, or chest hold the listed amount of ENC found in Clothing & Jewelry (page 182), but halve the total effective value of the ENC contained within them as long as the objects could reasonably fit.

When worn, the ENC of a given piece of armor is halved (round down). Shields do not benefit from this effect.

### Encumbrance Levels

The number of times that a character’s total ENC (the sum of the ENC of all the equipment they are carrying) exceeds their Carry Rating determines their Encumbrance Level. Higher encumbrance levels apply specific penalties:

- **Test Penalty:** A penalty to all physical and movement based Skill Tests and Characteristic Tests.
- **Speed Penalty:** A reduction of the character’s base Speed.
- **Stamina Penalty:** A reduction of the character’s SP max. For each level this would reduce it below 0 the character gains a level of fatigue.

These penalties represent the raw difficulty of carrying something too heavy for your character. Thus they can stack with penalties for wearing particularly heavy armor, which represent the difficulties of fighting while weighed down.

| Level | Value | Total ENC | Test Penalty | Speed Penalty | Stamina Penalty |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Minimal | 0 | <= 1 × Carry Rating | No Penalty | No Penalty | No Penalty |
| Moderate | 1 | > 1 × Carry Rating | -10 | -1 meter | -1 SP max |
| Severe | 2 | > 2 × Carry Rating | -20 | 1/2 Speed (round down) | -3 SP max |
| Crushing | 3 | > 3 × Carry Rating | -40 | Immobilized | -5 SP max |

## Character Advancement

The primary means by which characters progress in the UESRPG is through the accumulation and use of Experience Points (also known as XP) awarded by the GM. XP can be spent by characters to purchase characteristic advances, train new skills, increase skill ranks, gain specializations, learn new magic, and purchase talents. Remember that learning talents and ranking skills governed by a favored characteristic, or advancing that characteristic (increasing its score by 1), costs 75% of the usual XP cost (round down to the nearest multiple of 5).

> Optional Rule - Training Time  
> If the GM decides they dislike the idea of characters gaining skills and talents “instantly” during downtime, they can impose a training time upon their players. We recommend a rate of 1 week per 100 XP spent, though this is only a rough guideline.

Keep in mind that this table is different from the Character Creation table found at the end of Chapter 2. Once characters are past character creation, they are more restricted in what they can purchase with XP; for example, spells cannot be purchased with XP after character creation.
