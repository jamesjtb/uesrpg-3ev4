This chapter contains mechanics for resolving their attacker’s intentions, they have been surprised. The GM combat, as well as other game mechanics to handle the variety of should determine which characters count as being surprised for situations the players might encounter during their adventures. the first round of combat. Surprised characters do not roll 1d6 for initiative; they simply use their Initiative Rating. They also A Note on Time may only take reactions until after their first Turn has passed. The UESRPG divides time into two categories: narrative time and structured time. Narrative Time is meant to be used in Step 2: Set the Scene any situations that do not demand the time-sensitive resolution Before the characters can begin taking their turns, the GM of tasks. Functionally this means that almost any non-combat should outline the parts of the scenario that they are aware of, situation will use narrative time. In game terms, narrative time including the combatants they face, the positions of everyone is a period in which the GM can freely advance time at any rate involved, and the environment they’re fighting in.

Step 3: Determine Initiative To determine the order in which characters take their turns Structured Time is used to handle time-sensitive events in during each round of the combat, all characters involved must which every second counts and the exact order of actions is make an Initiative Roll. An Initiative Roll is made by roll- crucial. Combat almost always takes place in structured time, ing 1d6 and adding the character’s Initiative Rating.

At the start of the round, all char- acters replenish their AP.

Once their Turn is over, the character with the of “real” time. During a round the GM counts down from next highest initiative takes their Turn. This repeats until all highest to lowest initiative, giving each character a Turn to act characters have taken a Turn. when their initiative step is reached, until every character has had a Turn.

Disarm Primary Action Character makes an Athletics or unarmed Combat Style test which their opponent may oppose with their unarmed Combat Style or Athletics skill.

Step 3: Roll Tests & Determine Result If one character is able to gain a significant advantage over their opponent in melee, they are said to have gained an Advantage. Note that if a defender does not try to defend, or cannot do so, they are treated as having automatically failed.
• Both characters fail: Neither attack nor defense resolves.
• 1 character fails: The winner gains an advantage (if melee).
• A ttacker wins: The attack is successful, the attacker
chooses how to utilize their advantage, and resolves it.
• Defender wins: The defense is successful, the defender
chooses how to utilize their advantage and resolves it.
• Both characters pass: No characters gain an advantage.
• A ttack vs. Block: The defender blocks the attack

Improvised Weaponry In certain cases a character might find themselves forced to fight using improvised weaponry. Attacks with improvised weapons suffer the usual -20 untrained penalty unless the character’s Combat Style includes improvised weapons. The table below provides a set of guidelines for the GM. Improvised Weaponry Guidelines Type Damage Range Tiny 1d4 1m (gain Small quality) Small 1d6 1m Medium 1d8 2m Large 1d10 3m Huge 1d12 4m The GM should feel free to give certain improvised weapons appropriate weapon qualities based on the type of object. Unarmed Combat Unarmed combat is when a character fights using their natural weapons. Characters are always capable of attempting to fight in this manner, even if they do not have unarmed combat as part of their Combat Style. Characters attempt a Combat Style test using Strength or Agility with the standard -20 penalty for Grappling using an untrained skill, if applicable. In place of making a normal attack a character can choose to attempt to grapple their opponent.

Running Smooth Combat Encounters 1 This page provides some visual examples to help players under- stand how they might utilize battle grids and other tools to make combat run as smoothly as possible. Using a Grid The creators of the UESRPG highly recommend the use of a battle map or grid when running combat encounters. A grid helps players to understand their own situation, assists the GM in keeping track of the big picture, and makes understanding the consequences of combat ranges much easier. 2 The easiest way to use the UESRPG with a grid is to assume that each grid square represents a square meter. Two characters cannot share the same grid square, though characters can be allowed to pass through another character’s square if both parties are willing. The system also functions just fine on a hex grid. If you are using an online grid or map system that supports auras (as displayed in the example pictures) then using auras can be a good way to help players visualize their weapon ranges. Visual Examples Tracking Initiative & AP Above, the red mercenary wields a 2m range weapon (yellow One of the trickiest parts of running combat can be tracking aura) outside the 2m range (green aura) of the blue mercenary. how much AP a given character has remaining for the round.

Magic Damage Magic damage represents damage dealt by magical or elemental forces, such as burns from a fire ball spell. Poison is included in this category, though it is not always magical. There are sub-types of magic damage, each reduced by a corresponding armor type (and also reduced by generic magic AR). Magic Damage Types Sub-Type Armor Type (Any) Magic AR Magic Magic AR Fire Fire AR Frost Frost AR Shock Shock AR Poison Poison AR p h Shadow - hySiCal ealth Resolving Magic Damage vs Specific Damage During the course of the players’ adventures, it is very likely When resolving specific damage types against resistance or weak- that they will suffer injury of some kind. The following sections ness traits, the more specific value for the trait takes precedence. explain how to handle damage, fatigue, wounds, and death. For example: Jefe (pronounced “Geoff”) of the imperial guard is Damage & Hit Locations fending off a horde of zombies as they fall upon the city gates. Damage represents the ability of an attack to harm a character. Zombies have Resistance (Magic, 1) and Weakness (Fire, 3). Jefe Attacks against a character always strike a particular hit location, successfully casts Fire Bolt and rolls 5 for damage. When the spell and the damage of that attack is reduced by the Armor Rating affects the zombie, the Weakness (Fire, 3) trait is applied to the (AR) of that hit location. The Hit Location of an attack is usually damage without applying the resistance to magic resulting in a determined by the 1s digit of the attack roll, but can also be total of 8 fire damage being applied. determined by rolling 1d10 (counting 10 as 0). The characters Health Points (HP) are then reduced by the remaining amount. Death If a character is reduced to 0 Health Points remaining, then Hit Locations they fall unconscious. A character who is unconscious at 0 HP Result Location Hit must pass an Endurance test at the end of each of their turns.

However, some attacks and effects can deal other types of damage that can only be resisted with certain types of armor. Broadly, damage can be divided into two overall types: Physical Damage Physical damage represents physical cuts, jabs, and blows that harm a character through force of impact or blood loss (or both). All normal weapons deal physical damage, and physical damage is reduced by normal AR. 108

Wounds Wounds represent devestating injuries caused by more damaging attacks, and not just simple cuts and bruises. If a character ever takes damage from a single attack (including enchantments and/ or poisons) in excess of their Wound Threshold (WT), then they take a wound. Record the amount of damage and hit location, then follow these steps: Shock Effects First, the character must make a special Endurance test known as a Shock Test, which represents how well the character fares against the initial effects.

If they fail this test, the effect continues, and they may try again when it is their next Turn. 113

Combat Panic Test Results Roll Effect Startled: The character is startled by the source of panic. They jump in their boots and pause for a brief moment as 01-30 they struggle to reassess the situation. They may not make any reactions until the beginning of their next Turn.

They must 96-100 do everything in their power to accomplish this and is at a -20 penalty to all tests. Once away from the danger, they must successfully snap out of it to regain control, or the encounter must end. Combat Horror Test Results Roll Effect Momentary Blackout: The character is so overcome with horror that their mind fails them for a few precious 1-40 seconds in the face of this horror. The character drops to the ground unconscious for 1 round and has a -10 penalty to all actions afterwards for the rest of the encounter. Uncontrollable Vomiting: The character’s own body reacts with a gut wrenching sound as the character’s innards 41-60 empty themselves, and they start vomiting uncontrollably. The character bends over and vomits for 1 round and is considered helpless during this time. Afterwards the character is still nauseous and loses 1 Stamina point immediately. Manic Terror: The Character’s mind cracks like a fragile glass sculpture, and they begin to laugh maniacally. Turning upon the closest nearby friend or foe they start attacking them with whatever weapon they have in their hands at 61-80 the moment.

Afterwards the character loses 1d4 Stamina points immediately. Hopeless and Despairing: The character falls to the ground and cries out in despair and terror while shutting out all 81-90 other sounds, babbling and mumbling to themselves for comfort for 1d6 rounds.

The character goes catatonic for 1d4 hours and cannot be roused by normal means during this time. Mind Break: The character’s will bends as their mind shatters. They drop to the ground while stuttering and mumbling incomprehensibly for 1d6 rounds. The character’s mind is irrepressibly damaged, and they lose either 1d8 96-99 Willpower or Personality (player’s choice) permanently from the harrowing experience. Afterwards, the character cannot attack or approach the source of horror until they snap out of the effect or for the rest of the encounter. Scared to Death: The character is so immeasurably overcome with terror and horror that their heart stops beating; 100 they must make an Endurance test or die on the spot. Should they succeed, they instead fall catatonic for 1d4 hours as with Blackout. 114

Then, each dawn following contraction, the character must succeed an Endurance test +0 or the disease progresses to Stage Two. After each success, the next endurance test increases its penalty by 5 as the pain of the wound increases and the wound begins to fester. Once they have progressed to Stage Two, the character continues making increasingly difficult Endurance tests, but now starting at +0 and increasing in penalty by 10 per success as the festering of the wound grows. During Stage Three, resisting the disease’s progression becomes nearly impossible. The character continues to test Endurance each dawn, starting at no penalty, but each successful Endurance test now increases in penalty by 15 until the test is failed or the disease is cured. Once an Endurance test to resist progression is failed during stage three, the character has completed their transition into becoming a lycanthrope. They also immediately and painfully transform into their beast form, which counts as a use of their transformation ability. Once the character has completed their transition into Lycanthropy, the effects of the disease are negated and the wound becomes treatable. After this point, the lycanthropy cannot be cured by any commonly known mundane or magical means. 121
