Encountering Dwemer Spiders
Spiders are the worker class of dwemer constructs and typically
found in large numbers all over dwemer ruins.
They typically have eight articulated legs and a round central
body, which is where the name of Dwemer Spider comes from,
beyond that they almost always have a soul gem mounted
somewhere on their central body which they can use to their
power electrical abilities.
As the worker class, these constructs tend to fight in groups
rather than taking on foes on their own. In many cases they are
not aggressive, being more focused on the maintenance of their
domains. However when attacked they are perfectly willing to
fight until they are destroyed, many of them are capable of
setting off a chain reaction when close to their end, so adven-
turers should be wary of getting caught between a group of
them.
Loot

Smithing) test over a short rest to recover 1d4 pieces of
dwemer scrap metal worth 90 Drakes and 2 ENC each.

Constructors are a relatively rare form of Dwemer Animunculi,
usually only found in especially large Dwemer complexes or in
locations that were once dedicated to the construction of the
Dwemer constructs themselves.
These strange constructs appear to share certain design similarities
with both Dwemer Spiders and the larger Dwemer Centurions
but they serve an entirely different purpose, whilst most constructs
were created as war engines or guards, the Constructor is a
builder.
They are capable of maintaining other Dwemer Constructs even
in the midst of battle and even creating the smaller constructs
in a staggeringly short amount of time thanks to reserves of
dwemer alloy.

Smithing) test over a short rest to recover 2d4 pieces of
dwemer scrap metal worth 90 Drakes and 2 ENC each.

Encountering Dwemer Ballista
One of the most dangerous Steam Animunculi is the Dwarven
Ballista, which fires a bolt that can penetrate even the thickest
Armor.
The Dwemer created the ballistae as guardians and ranged
support for their homes and armies respectively, and whilst the
Dwemer are long since dead, the ballista maintain their vigil
over their masters ancient homes. These Animunculi are rarely
alone, usually other centurions are close by and quickly alerted
when a ballista becomes aware of intruders.
The ballista’s bolts are incredibly powerful and capable of firing
at ranges that exceed smaller crossbows and bows alike which
makes them a daunting foe to face unless the foe can sneak up
on them, to be hit by one of their bolts typically spells the end
of the target, or at least scars worthy of a story or two. Despite
this, they take a long time to reload which can create an opening,
assuming whatever support the ballista had has already been
dealt with.
Loot
• A character can attempt a +0 Profession (Engineering or
Smithing) test over a short rest to recover 2d4 pieces of
dwemer scrap metal worth 90 Drakes and 2 ENC each.
• On a -10 Profession (Engineering or Smithing) or +0
Mysticism test, a character can extract a lesser soul gem from
the animunculi’s  chassis over the course of a short rest.
• A character can recover 1d10 of the bolts the ballista uses,
these are too large to use as bolts, but they can be modified
with a +0 Smithing test to be used as Dwemer Javelin instead.
• A character can attempt a -20 Alchemy test to extract DoS+2
doses of Dwarven Oil, which is a Very Rare Alteration
ingredient.Characteristics Attributes Skills

Encountering Dwemer Spheres
Dwemer Spheres are another common form of Dwemer construct.
They typically move around in sphere form allowing them to
navigate the specially designed pipework most dwemer ruins
contain. However when they enter a state of combat readiness,
the sphere splits and a mechanical humanoid torso, head and
arms emerge, each arm ends in a weapon or shield their heads
are typically stylized visages of their dwemeri creators.
They are not sentient and thus technically do not have any kind
of intelligence, however their creators provided them with the
ability to handle complex tactical situations.
They remain in the ancient ruins of Dwemer civilization and
are typically very aggressive toward anything entering their
masters domain despite the disappearance of the dwemer.

Smithing) test over a short rest to recover 2d4 pieces of
dwemer scrap metal worth 90 Drakes and 2 ENC each.

extending above it.

• Sphere: This creature has one Leg hit location.
• Weakness (Shock, 3)
Encountering Dwemer Sentries
Dwemer Sentries are the smallest of the animunculi, similar in
appearance to miniature dwemer spheres when in their sphere
form, they lack the obvious combat configuration seen on many
other Dwemer constructs when in their transformed form.
However, when their “head” a small metal device with a single
“eye” is extended, they’re quite capable of dealing with unpre-
pared foes with bolts of lightning and static shocks.
The purpose of Dwemer Sentries was to patrol their master’s
home and alert them to the presence of intruders. Whilst their
masters are now long gone, they continue to carry out this task
diligently, following intruders and making sure the more combat
effective animunculi are alerted and able to deal with them
effectively.
Some Dwemer ruins even have specific platforms for these small
constructs to lock themselves into, at which point they become
even more deserving of their name.
Loot
• A character can attempt a +0 Profession (Engineering or
Smithing) test over a short rest to recover 1d4 pieces of
dwemer scrap metal worth 90 Drakes and 2 ENC each.
• On a -10 Profession (Engineering or Smithing) or +0
Mysticism test, a character can extract a petty soul gem from

Encountering Dwemer Centurions
Dwemer Centurions are incredibly powerful foes due to their
sheer size, durability, and strength. They can be outfitted to hit
hard both in melee and at range, and their defenses can weather
all but the most devastating attacks.
In combat Dwemer Centurions are aggressive and single-
minded. They will focus on the greatest threat that is easily
within their reach, and rarely attempt to defend against opponents
other than their selected target, instead relying on their natural
defenses. When faced with groups, they tend to utilize their
rapidly spinning torsos.

• A character can attempt a +0 Profession (Engineering or
Smithing) test over a short rest to recover 4d4 pieces of
dwemer scrap metal worth 90 Drakes and 2 ENC each.
• On a -10 Profession (Engineering or Smithing) or +0
Mysticism test, a character can extract a greater soul gem
from the animunculi’s chassis over the course of a short rest.

This enormous Dwemer construct has exaggerated proportions that
still resemble that of a humanoid. One arm ends in a strange cylin-
der that spins and burns with fire, the other is a huge fist.

be knocked prone, creatures within 2m attempt the test at
-10 and suffer 1d8 damage that ignores armor on a failure.
• Steam Breath (1 AP + 1 SP):  As an attack, Dwemer Colossus
can quickly cool itself by unleashing a wave of scalding
steam, which is a 15m cone that deals 1d12 fire damage to
all targets.
• Sweeping Strike (1 SP): As part of an all-out attack, the
Dwemer Colossus can strike up to 5 targets with it’s Dwemer
Colossus Fist as a single attack. Roll once for the attack, and
resolve damage separately against all struck targets.
• Volcanic Bombardment (1 AP + 5 SP): As an attack the
Dwemer Colossus charges its Enkindling Projector, launching
a huge ball of fire towards a location within 50m, dealing
3d10 fire damage to any characters caught within a 2m wide
line. Upon reaching it’s target location, it explodes, dealing
3d10 fire damage to any characters caught with 10m and
persists for 10 rounds, dealing 1d10 fire damage to any
characters who pass through it or end their turn there.T raits
• Mechanical

Encountering Dwemer Colossi
The Colossus is the rarest of the different Dwemer Animunculi,
with very few examples ever having been encountered, they are
huge engines and represent an incredible feat of engineering.
Little is known of them, even their existence is obscure knowledge
that only a scholar of dwemer technology would know anything
about. Their immense size means they are only found in the
largest of Dwemer ruins.
They resemble a considerably larger, bulkier version of the
Dwemer Centurion. A colossus is a formidable opponent indeed,
quite capable of protecting whatever ruin it is found in from
almost any threat.
Loot
• A character can attempt a +0 Profession (Engineering or
Smithing) test over a long rest to recover 4d12 pieces of
dwemer scrap metal worth 90 Drakes and 2 ENC each.
• On a -10 Profession (Engineering or Smithing) or +0
Mysticism test, a character can extract a grand soul gem
from the animunculi’s chassis over the course of a short rest.
• A character can attempt a -20 Profession (Engineering or
Smithing) test over a short rest to recover the Dwemer
Colossus’ dynamo core, worth 300 Drakes and 2 ENC.

was me they were afraid of until I saw the Dwarven constructs swarming out of Mudan. I tried to fight past them to get at Ver-
ano, but wasn't making much headway until Boldekh and the bear arrived. We took out the spiders and turned toward Verano,
who ran toward Mudan. Bad mistake: its gates exploded with magical flame as a Dwarven colossus strode out."
