192192Loot T ables
Using Loot T ables
The entries for the loot tables included in this book are generally
organized in ascending order of perceived or concrete value.
The GM can choose to have the players roll on the table or roll
on their behalf. When making a loot table roll, use a die size
that is determined by the threat rating of the character who
owns or occupies the looted area as follows:
▪ T rivial: 1d6
▪ Minor: 1d8
▪ Average: 1d10
▪ Major: 1d12
▪ Extreme: 2d8
▪ Legendary: 2d12
The GM may affect the result by applying any modifier they
like to the roll. For example, if the owner/occupant of the looted
area is particularly rich or powerful, the GM may choose to add
a +4 modifier to the resulting roll. Or, in the opposite case, the
owner or occupant might be less wealthy, which might warrant
a negative modifier.Location T ypes
The Loot Tables provided in this section are sorted by the type
of location or being looted. When looting an NPC, GMs would
use the Loot section found in that NPC’s profile rather than
having the character roll on a loot table, with some exception
up to GM discretion.
Finds and T reasure
Characters will roll on the Finds table of a location type when
they successfully search individual people, unremarkable stor-
age, or the general space of the area that would reasonably
contain loot.
Characters will roll on the T reasure table of a location type
when looting treasure stashes of the area, which are often se-
cured or guarded.
