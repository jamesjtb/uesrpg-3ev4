## Chapter 1: Using This Book

### NPCs vs Player Characters
Non-Player Characters (NPCs) constitute the majority of the world encountered by Player Characters (PCs).
NPCs are governed by special rules and simplified abstractions intended for Game Masters.

Key differences:
- NPCs do **not** have Luck unless explicitly stated.
- NPCs cannot use Heroic Actions unless granted the **Elite** trait.
- NPCs automatically fail Luck tests.

### Critical Results for NPCs
Unless otherwise specified:
- Roll **1–3** → Critical Success
- Roll **98–100** → Critical Failure

---

## NPC Profiles

NPC Profiles define how a creature or character is run mechanically.

### Profile Elements
- Name + Flavor Text
- Keywords
- Stat Table
- Equipment
- Special Actions
- Traits
- Spells
- Variants
- Encounter Behavior
- Loot

### Keywords Format
Subtype, Type; Difficulty; Soul Type (Soul Energy)

## Design Notes for AI Agents

- Numeric modifiers always stack unless stated otherwise.
- NPC Skills are abstractions; do not expand into PC skill trees.
- Flavor text is non-mechanical unless stated.
