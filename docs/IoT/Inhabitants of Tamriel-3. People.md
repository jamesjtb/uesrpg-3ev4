“It is the right and duty of all sentient beings to be masters of
their own fate, to live or die according to their own wishes.
Slavery is a foul practice that takes this choice from those
bound under its terrible yoke, transferring their decision-mak-
ing capacity to the owner.This is neither fair nor right, and
should be resisted as violently as possible, everywhere and at all
times. Anyone who stands idly by and lets another be enslaved
is no better than the one who cracks the whip.”
