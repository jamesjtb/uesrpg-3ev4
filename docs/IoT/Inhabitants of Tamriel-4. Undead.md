89Bonelords
Bonelord
A four armed revenant, purposefully assembled from the bones of
the sacred dead. They are often found protecting the ancestral tombs
of Morrowind.
Bonelord, Undead; Average; White Soul (400)
Weapons and Armor
• Skeletal Claws: 1d8; Slashing; Reach 1m
May also have:
• Paired Ritual Daggers:  1d4+1; Slashing, Exploit Weakness,
Thrown (5/10/15), Small; Reach 1m, 1H; wields one in
each hand
Special Abilities
• Bladestorm (1 SP): As part of a melee weapon attack, a
Bonelord can strike up to three targets in Reach as a single
action. This counts as a single attack.
• Refresh Spells (1 SP): The Bonelord can, as a free action,
refresh MP equal to half their max MP . If they have the
optional Spellcaster trait, they refresh all of their spell uses
instead.
"The agility and fighting ability of the animated remains
may depend on the abilities of the revenant's former life, and
may therefore be weak or strong, or more or less capable with
weapons and shields. Fortunately, enchanted weapons are not
needed to destroy skeletons. An exception is the bonelord, a
peculiar form of revenant that seems to derive its powers
more from its spirit energies than from the substance of its
skeletal remains. Bonelords are very powerful, and very dan-
gerous. Normal weapons do not affect them."

Encountering Bonelords
Bonelords are complex undead constructs created by Dunmer
priests and sorcerers, using sacred rites to raise holy servants to
guard the ancestral tombs and burial grounds of their people.
Creating a bonelord is a great deal of work, and requires multiple
intact skeletons, which are combined to create a multi-armed
monstrosity that attacks with unrivaled speed and ferocity, and
is imbued with basic spells.
Bonelords patrol their stations for the entirety of their existence;
when first created, bonelords are bound to a sacred location
forever, which is often also the site of their fabrication. Nothing,
not even the commanding will of their creator can remove a
bonelord from their post. Once given a charge, they will defend
it for time unending.
Loot
• A Bonelord carries simple talismans and sacred chimes,
worth d10 drakes.
• On a +0 Alchemy test over a Short Rest, a character can
harvest and powder DoS doses of the Bonelord's sacred
bonemeal, which are Very Rare Alteration ingredients. Characteristics Attributes Skills

Encountering Ancient Bonelords
Ancient Bonelords were created in ages long past by powerful
Dunmer priests and sorcerers, principally to guard the tombs
of the most sacred and revered dead.
The knowledge of how to make these powerful undead constructs
has been lost to time, however this does not stop Ancient
Bonelords from carrying out their sacred duties. Ancient
Bonelords will patrol the halls of their tombs for their entire
existence, falling upon intruders with speed and ferocity un-
matched by even the most terrible beasts.

• Drain Strength / Endurance (1 AP + 1 SP): The Bonewalker
targets a creature within 50m and magically drains either
their Strength or Endurance as an attack. The target suffers
a -10 on all tests that use the afflicted Characteristic for 1

the afflicted Characteristic for the same amount of time.
This effect is cumulative. The target can attempt to resist
the Drain with a -20 Willpower test.T raits

Bonewalker take d4 damage on their turn that ignores armor.
Encountering Bonewalkers
Bonewalkers are found guarding tombs in Morrowind and may
be summoned by magicians. The bonewalker inspires dread
through the terrible curses it can lay.
Large and heavily altered compared to the typical undead
construct, Bonewalkers are revenant ancestors of Dunmer who
guard the hallowed burial grounds and are created from the
sacred dead to watch over their hallowed ground. The
bonewalker attacks with infectious claws and magics that allow
them to drain their foes of their strength and endurance.
These traits mean that Bonewalkers make for a deadly foe, and
a welcome ally in the right circumstances.
Loot
• On a +10 Alchemy test over a Short Rest, a character can
harvest and powder DoS doses of the bonewalker's bonemeal,
which are Common Alteration ingredients.
• On a +0 Alchemy test over a Short Rest, a character can

Uncommon Destruction ingredient. If the character fails
this test, they instead contract Common Disease. Characteristics Attributes Skills

Greater Bonewalkers are a stronger, sturdier cousins of their
more common counterpart. Their magical might can cripple
victims, stunting their physical capabilities outright rather than
merely sapping them temporarily. Unlike the curses of the lesser
Bonewalker, the greater Bonewalker’s curses are permanent until
dispelled by a skilled healer.
These foul undead are typically found guarding the tombs of
particularly powerful or influential Dunmer houses, however
those skilled in necromancy are known to summon them to
serve their profane wills.

93Bonewolf
“Foul beasts, not of this earth. These are creatures brought into
existence by black magic. They are a mockery of the true and good
wolves that roam this land.” – A Skaal
Undead; Minor; White Soul (120)
Weapons and Armor
• Bite: 1d6; Slashing; Reach 1m
Special Abilities
• Latch On (1 SP):  If the creature successfully Bites a target
which results in a grapple, it latches on as a free action. As
a result, the grappled character receives a -20 penalty to their
attempts to break free. Alternatively, the grappled target can
instead end the grapple as a free action. In doing so, they
suffer the Bleeding (2) Condition and must test for Disease.
T raits
• Skeletal
• Undead
• Strong Jaws: A Bite attack made by this character that deals
damage automatically starts a Grapple. The test to contest
this Grapple is made against the original test made by the
attacker. If the target Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the
Counter Attack ignores the creature’s AR and Natural
Toughness trait.
• Diseased (+20):  If this creature deals at least one point of
damage after mitigation to another character with their
natural weapons then that character must test Endurance
+20 or contract a Common Disease.
• Dark Sight:  A creature with this trait can see and act nor-
mally in areas with dim or no light.
• Quadruped
• T eamwork:  The character adds a bonus degree of success to
any successful Combat Style tests made to attack or defend
against opponents in melee range as long as that opponent
is also within melee range of an ally who also has this talent.
• Unrelenting:  Enemies within melee range of the character
cannot take the disengage action.Encountering Bonewolves
Bonewolves are the reanimated skeletons of wolves. Beyond the
obvious undead features Bonewolves are rather similar to their
previous living forms, as such most strategies used in fighting
wolves can be used against bonewolves as well.
Bonewolves retain much of the cunning they had in life, and
attack in violent packs, unfettered by notions of self preservation,
driven on by an insatiable hunger for flesh. They will attack as
a pack, strategically crippling and dragging superior foes to the
ground with numbers, wit, and ferocity.
Bonewolves can be encountered in and around the lairs of potent
and clever necromancers, wise enough to create the bonewolves
as a first line of security. Bonewolves will typically patrol the
region immediately surrounding their master’s lair, which they
consider their den, and treat much as a wolf would be expected
to treat their own territory. As such, they become violently
territorial and will attack on sight, and will hound their prey
for miles, restlessly.
A necromancer will also use bonewolves as a means to hunt for
food to provide the necromancer with much needed sustenance;
while the areas of meat immediately in contact with the
bonewolves’ jaws will certainly necrotize and spoil, the rest of
the flesh is salvageable, and provides a necromancer with a
reliable food supply that they doesn’t need to lift a finger to
acquire.

• Over a Short Rest, a character can test Alchemy +10 to grind
up DoS doses of bonemeal, which are Common Alteration
ingredients. Characteristics Attributes Skills

Special Abilities

which results in a grapple, it latches on as a free action. As
a result, the grappled character receives a -20 penalty to their
attempts to break free. Alternatively, the grappled target can

• Grave Fang (1 SP):  After dealing damage with a Chilling
Bite, a Death Hound can spend an SP to immediately drain
1 SP from the target.

is also within melee range of an ally who also has this talent.
• Unrelenting:   Enemies within melee range of the character
cannot take the disengage action.Encountering Death Hounds
Death Hounds are a type of undead canine found across Tamriel
as guard dogs for those who engage in black magic. Vampires
seem to be especially fond of using Death Hounds as compan-
ions.
With its large, bright red eyes, jet-black skin and impressive
teeth, the Death Hound makes for an intimidating guard dog,
which makes it a popular choice for many aspiring necromancers
and vampires.
It is unknown to scholarly sources how Death Hounds came
into existence, but it is strongly theorized that they are dogs
that have been conventionally infected with a canine-strain of
Sanguinare Vampiris, or a similar version of vampirism.
The Death Hound’s bite is reputedly extremely chilling, and
causes flash-frostbite which blackens and brittles the flesh.
Loot
• On a +0 Survival test, a character can remove the Death
Hound's hide, worth 20 drakes, over the course of a Short
Rest. If the character fails this test, the hide is spoiled, halving
its worth.
• On a +20 Survival test, a character can, over the course of
a Long Rest, turn a Death Hound hide into one piece of
Full Death Hound Hide armor. Death Hound Hide armor
is exactly the same as regular Hide.
• On a +20 Simple Survival test over a Short Rest, a character
can harvest DoS days' rations of Death Hound meat, which
will spoil within a day if not properly preserved. A character
must test Endurance +20 when consuming Death Hound
meat or else take 1 Frost damage that ignores resistances. Characteristics Attributes Skills

• Undead
• Resistance (Frost, 2)Encountering Draugr Thrall
Draugr are the shriveled, restless husks of ancient Nords, dating
back to the age when the Dragon Cult ruled over Skyrim.
Brought to undeath by the dark magicks of the Dragon Priests,
Draugr guard the tombs of their lords and masters for eternity.
Draugr can be found guarding ancient Nordic ruins, including
haunted barrows, sunken cities, and sprawling temples. Draugr
are bound to the will of their Lord, and by extension the Dragon
Priests, and will follow their leadership without question or
complaint. They have been given everlasting life of questionable
quality by their masters, and continue to serve them in their
undeath.
Draugr typically patrol their burial grounds, or the areas
immediately around them, either alone or in small groups. They
typically lack the drive or motive to attack settlements, but
under the command of a Draugr Lord they may become a
roaming, aggressive force that needs no food, rest, or medicine.
When encountered in their burial grounds, Draugr will fight
ferociously, but will also not hesitate to retreat to better posi-
tions, or go to warn the rest of the undead garrison.
Draugr are intelligent undead, and as such can plan and strategize,
though their greater faculties have mostly been drained away
over the centuries, leaving them primitive and easily fooled.
However, in the presence of a greater Draugr, even the lowest
thralls of the Dragons become something to be feared.
Loot
• A group of Draugr often carry treasures worth a number of
rolls on the T reasure Table determined by the GM.
• A character can harvest a Draugr's tongue, which is a Common
Destruction ingredient.Characteristics Attributes Skills

• Undead
• Resistance (Frost, 2)Encountering Draugr Wights
Draugr Wights are stronger and and more resilient undead
servants of the Dragon Cult than the more common Thrall.
Much like other Draugr, Wights can be found endlessly patrolling
the tombs of their lords in search of intruders and grave robbers.
Wights can often be found leading small groups of Thrall,
typically under the command of a Draugr Lord, and will follow
their orders without hesitation. While countless centuries of
undeath have drained their faculties, Wights are not mindless.
They make use of simple tactics when in battle and will even
retreat to warn others of their kind should a foe prove powerful
enough.

• Dual Fighter: Raise the maximum number of attacks to 3

Encountering Draugr Scourges
Draugr Scourges dwell amongst the Draugr, standing head and
shoulders above their lesser peers. During the time of the Dragon
Cult, the gifted children of cultists were indoctrinated into the
cult and taught the powers of the Thu'um by their Dovah
masters. Draugr Scourges simply represent all manner of such
greater Draugr, who retain the mystical knowledge of the past.
Draugr Scourges can be encountered amongst normal Draugr,
often leading a small warband and using the prestige and clout
they had in life to seize a sort of basic leadership role in battle.
A Draugr Scourge is a champion of melee combat, and a
practitioner of the Thu'um, making them a deadly opponent
to an unprepared adventurer. A Draugr Scourge excels at both
dueling and fighting against groups, and is comfortable using
a diverse set of weapons for different jobs. They can be thought
of as being champion level Draugr, more than an even match
for a heroic character.
Loot
• A group of Draugr often carry treasures worth a number of
rolls on the T reasure Table determined by the GM.
• A character can harvest a Draugr's tongue, which is a Common
Destruction ingredient.Characteristics Attributes Skills

Draugr Wight Lords are deadly foes, champions of the Dragon
Cult in life and some of their greatest warriors in death. They
often serve as leaders to the lesser Draugr, charging into battle
against any who would intrude upon their sacred tombs without
mercy.
Despite lacking the gift of the Thu’um, a Wight Lord can be a
formidable foe on its own. When accompanied by others of it’s
kind, however, they can become a challenge for even the most
experienced and well-equipped adventurers.
When not patrolling the halls of their crypts Wight Lords often
serve as bodyguards to Deathlords and Dragon Priests, wielding
their martial prowess against any who would approach.

100Encountering Draugr Deathlords
A Draugr Deathlord is a fearsome foe. Both skilled at martial
combat and with the use of the Thu'um, a Deathlord is not
easily bested. Combined with their ability to muster Draugr to
give them bonus attacks, makes fighting a Deathlord in their
home turf an absolutely brutal fight. Characters hunting a
Draugr Deathlord should take special care to separate him from
their retinue, or have a way to quickly deal with them or the
Deathlord will overwhelm them with volume of attacks.
The Deathlord has 4 AP , meaning they have a LOT of potential
attacks and defenses, and combined with their Slow Time shout,
a Deathlord is more than a match for a party of adventurers.
Draugr Deathlords are often found in the deepest part of their
ruins, often accompanying or protecting the sarcophagus of
their Dragon Priest master, if they have one. Some more ambi-
tious Deathlords occasionally attack settlements, but this hasn't
happened in a long time. Because Deathlords are so often on
the defensive, they have time to plot out elaborate and cruel
defensive strategies, and have often designed their sanctums to
be "kill rooms," built for the explicit purpose of absolutely
halting any invading forces with extreme force.
Loot
• A group of Draugr often carry treasures worth a number of
rolls on the T reasure Table determined by the GM.
• A character can harvest a Draugr's tongue, which is a Common
Destruction ingredient.

101Dragon Priest
Of all the mortals within the Dragon Cult, the Dragon Priests were
undeniably the greatest followers. Trained intensely in the ways of
their Masters, with the strongest even earning sacred masks filled
with power and status, Dragon Priests are the deadliest creatures
within the Nordic Ruins.
Draugr, Undead; Extreme; White Soul (1200)
Weapons and Armor
• Wretched Talons: 1d6; Slashing, Small, Magic; Reach 1m
May have:
• Dragon Priest Staff:  1d6(1d8)+2; Concussive, Focus, Magic,
Innate Spell (see Special Abilities) ; Reach 2m, 1.5H
Also may have up to two of:
• Dragon Priest Robes:  AR 6 / Magic 6; Partial, Heavy,
Magic
• Full Dragon Priest Mask:  AR 7 / Magic 7;  Magic, Light
Special Abilities
• Consume Thralls (1 AP + 1 SP): As a Primary Action
Dragon Priest can consume the life of any nearby Draugr it
chooses within 30m. The consumed Draugr immediately
and irreversibly dies, unable to be raised, because its essence
has been stripped bare by the Dragon Priest. The Dragon
Priest can do this to as many Draugr in range as they wish.
The Dragon Priest then gains Temporary Hit points that
last until the end of the encounter equal to the remaining
HP of the Draugr they consume.
• Innate Spell (1 AP): The Dragon Priest’s Staff is infused
with a spell that can be cast for no Magicka cost, and always
succeeds with 1 DoS. It may be infused with one of the
following spells:
▪ Fire Bolt 3: 7 MP; 1d8 Fire; R Attack (100m), Overload
(+WB to Dmg)
▪ Frost Bolt 3: 7 MP; 1d8 Frost; R Attack (100m),
Overload (+WB to Dmg)
▪ Shock Bolt 3: 7 MP; 1d8 Shock; R Attack (100m),
Overload (+WB to Dmg)T raits
• Undead
• Bend Reality: Can test Magic instead of Physical.
• Imbued with Magicka: Does not spend MP to cast spells.
• Lord of Sorcery:  A Dragon Priest never backfires, and can
cast any level of spell without penalty.
• Master of the Voice: Can use two word shouts without
spending Stamina, can test Endurance at +0 to avoid spend-
ing Stamina on three word Shouts.
• Resistance (Frost, 3)
• Resistance (Normal Weapons, 3)
Encountering Dragon Priests
Dragon Priests are so diverse and characterful, it would be a
disservice to rigidly describe them here. Instead, it is up to GMs
to develop their own Dragon Priests , since if one is included
it is likely going to be a major villain for a campaign and de-
serves special attention.
Dragon Priests are both sorcerers, and Tongues, and combine
the use of profane magicks with the reality bending potency of
the Thu'um. A Dragon Priest, being a creature of the Merethic
Era, knows as many Shouts as the GM determines appropriate ,
up to the full power of the Shout. Additionally, a Dragon Priest
is equally proficient in all Schools of magic, and as a result can
take spells from any school . The GM is encouraged to create
a creative and powerful spell list, and really take advantage of
the Imbued with Magicka trait to really go crazy with spells.
For example, while a Dragon Priest does not innately have the
Fly trait, because it is able to cast without spending Magicka it
can effectively have a level 7 Levitate at all times.
A party needs to be prepared with sufficient anti magic, because
a Dragon Priest has no reason to hold back its awe-inspiring
destructive powers, because it is not confined to the mortal
understandings of magic. Even if a party somehow negates its
sorceries, it still has a very powerful Thu'um to reckon with.

their sanctum. Additionally, they should design a unique
enchantment for their Mask.Characteristics Attributes Skills

The soul of a dead mortal, trapped on Nirn.

light they lose 1 SP each hour. Cloud cover or other such
weather halves the rate of SP loss. The character must spend
an hour in a dark place before they can remove levels of
fatigue/regain SP lost in this manner.Spells
• Frost Bolt 2:  6 MP , 1d6 Frost, R Attack (100m), Overload
(+WB to Dmg)

Variant: Ancient Ghost
Special Abilities
• Vanish (1 SP): The Ancient Ghost becomes Invisible for d4
Rounds.
Encountering Ghosts
Ghosts are the souls of those who have died and are now trapped
within Nirn unable to leave. They can be found manifesting all
across Tamriel. Ghost are most often found within ancient
tombs or haunting graveyards. That said, they can also be found
practically everywhere else either naturally or because of dark
necromancies being cast to summon them.
Ghosts that naturally occur are bound to Mundus in ethereal
form, often because of some unfinished business that needs
attending before the spirit can move on. Usually, a ghost devolves
into unending madness, their past life and the business that ties
them to Mundus long forgotten and unresolved. The ghost’s
torment in reality, one foot in and one foot out, is agonizing
and ceaseless until they are vanquished by the living, banished
into death by force.
This in mind, slaying a ghost that has gone mad is a great and
noble service, as it delivers them from the shackles of their
endless anguish.

Weaker and less powerful than other liches, these undead necromancers
have become spectral shadows of their former selves.

A full sentence to a maximum number of characters equal

dred times their WB. They must have line of sight to the
character to whom they are broadcasting, unless the target
character has this trait as well. Characters with this trait can
make a Perception test as a free action to attempt to locate
other characters with this trait within their broadcast range,
though this test can be opposed by a Willpower test if a
character wishes to remain hidden.
• Thought Caster: The character does not need to speak or
have hands free in order to cast spells.
Encountering Nether Liches
Nether Liches are weaker than other varieties of Lich, often
appearing spectral when compared to others of their kind. The
reason for this incorporeal form can vary; perhaps the Lich
failed at some critical step in granting itself un-life, or maybe
they sought to use powers they did not fully grasp to cheat death
which backfired in some way.
In any case, Nether Liches can still prove challenging foes for
a party to face. They can still raise hordes of the dead to defend
themselves against adventurers and their abilities make them
deadly enemies in their own right. GMs who wish to use Nether
Liches in their game should outfit them with appropriately
deadly spells, if perhaps less potent  than those a Lich-proper
can wield.

Encountering Liches
Liches are extremely powerful foes, and make great villains,
primarily because their nature as powerful mages allows the
GM to be extremely creative. There is almost no limit to the
kind of knowledge and skills that a Lich can acquire over its
unnatural lifetime. For this reason, GMs should create custom
magic items and develop their own spell list  for a Lich. They
are no throwaway monster of the week.
A Lich does not survive centuries without a measure of cunning.
A Lich is not often going to be encountered outside its lair,
which will functionally be its own private fortress. The Lich
will be surrounded by powerful undead, acolytes, and will use
its masterful knowledge of magicka to bend the environment
and turn the dungeon or ruin itself into a dangerous foe.

Encountering Ancient Liches
Ancient Liches are powerful beyond measure. They are often
relics of bygone eras; the most powerful necromancers of their
age who used their talents to cheat death itself.
They are often reclusive, keeping to themselves as they pursue
the higher mysteries of the universe or the interplay between
life and death itself. To defend themselves and this pursuit of
knowledge Ancient Liches will raise entire legions of undead
to serve their will. Under the right set of calamitous circum-
stances they may even send these undead armies to war against
the living of Nirn to see their insatiable appetite for power
appeased, offering GMs a perfect villain for their campaign.
GMs who wish to use these powerful undead  should outfit
them with powerful spells and abilities beyond those sug-
gested here to ensure they are appropriately dangerous foes for
a party to encounter.

"Power, my dear friend. I seek power, and so I acquire and study those who have some degree of it. We are after the same things,
your guild and I. Yet you worry about 'good' and 'evil' and do not accept they are manifestations of the same thing. So you brand
me a villain, and make vain attempts to destroy me. I watch, and I wait, and I collect you when you come for me."

• Resistance (Frost, Normal Weapons, 2)Encountering Skeletons
Skeletons are the reanimated bones that many necromancers
and other dark magics can create and command. Usually found
in or around ancient ruins or guarding a necromancer’s lair,
they can be potent foes against the average adventurer and pose
a serious threat to untrained combatants. More experienced
adventurers should have no problem disposing of them, but
they tend to have numbers on their side. Additionally, due to
their lack of internal organs and not needing core body muscles
to function, many otherwise well-placed blows and thrusts will
go cleanly between their ribs and other bones, leaving them
mostly unscathed.
If encountered as a servant to a necromancer, a skeleton will
fiercely fight to protect its master, as it is bound by the black
magics holding it together to do so as its imperative task.
Skeletons under direct control of a necromancer are able to
fight intelligently, acting as an extension of the necromancer
himself.
If found without a master, a skeleton will usually attack anything
on sight for no apparent reason. In this case, skeletons are little
more than wild animals. They may fight to the death or simply
take a few swings and run when things get dangerous.

Encountering Skeletal Champions
Skeletal Champions are an enemy not to be trifled with by lesser
experienced adventurers. These monstrosities can and will cleave
through even the strongest adventurers, and should be treated
as such. They are often found leading bands of skeletons as a
de facto leader, though whether its because the Champion is of
greater intelligence or because it is simply imbued with greater
power and projects an unnatural magnetism, is unknown.
These champions are to be feared far more than their normal
counterparts. They are more powerful in every single aspect,
including the use of magical weapons and armor, as well as more
advanced fighting techniques.
Skeletal Champions can be very potent guards for necromancers
as well. Used only by more powerful necromancers, they often
act as personal bodyguards for the dark mage that creates them.
If a Skeletal Champion is without a master, it will act with
independence and autonomy, unlike a masterless skeleton. A
lone Skeletal Champion will be smarter and more powerful,
and can often use this cunning to even find other skeletons or
other undead to lead by itself.

111Encountering Wraiths
Deep in the dark corners of Nirn, there are some spirits who
know no rest. Some manifest into simple ghosts. Others, those
whose hearts were full of spite and hatred, become wraiths.
Wraiths are devoid of reason, attacking all that lives with blind
abandon. Their incorporeal nature make them dangerous to
those in heavy armor, simply phasing through their opponent’s
armor with their ghostly claws. Along with their withering
claws, wraiths are infamous for their fell magics. They have
powers that can deaden flesh with cold, sap the energy from
living creatures or steal their own voice.
Loot
• When a wraith dies, it vanishes, including its spectral armor
and weapons.
• A character can test a -10 Alchemy test to gather one dose
of ectoplasm, which is a Very Rare Mysticism ingredient."Powerful and aggressive, wraiths are spirits full of hatred for
the living. They do occur naturally, and most studies suggest
that they are formed from individuals who suffer great injus-
tice and leave important work undone."

113Encountering Gloom Wraiths
While they have many similarities with Wraiths, Gloom Wraiths
are known to be much more dangerous due to their prowess
with blade or claw and eldritch knowledge of magic. Their origin
is not certain, but they most often appear to be wearing purple
robes, the color of nobility, and are graced with crowns upon
their heads. This has lead some necrologists to speculate that
gloom wraiths are the cursed spirits of members of nobility, or
even royalty.
They are deadly foes for any adventurer to face, as their powerful
spells and war gear can make short work of the ill-prepared who
venture into a Gloom Wraith’s demesne. Their ancient and long
forgotten nobility also means that Gloom Wraiths are often
accompanied by other forms of undead; servants bound to their
wills for all eternity.
Loot
• When a Gloom Wraith dies, it vanishes, including its spectral
armor and weapons.
• A character can test a -10 Alchemy test to gather one dose
of Ectoplasm, which is a Very Rare Mysticism ingredient."Wraiths. Unlike the other manifestations, wraiths are spirits
governed by strong emotions. In order to call forth and com-
mand a wraith, you must learn how to twist a spirit into its
darkest expression. Allow the anger and rage of a life cut
short to govern the spirit's form as you summon it. Master
raising the dead, and you will command them with ease."

114Zombies
Zombie
Zombies are animated, rotting corpses. Hordes of them can be found
serving Necromancers across T amriel.
Zombie, Undead; Minor; White Soul (100)
Weapons and Armor
• Fetid Claws:  1d4; Slashing; Reach 1m
Special Abilities
• Unstoppable (1 SP): As a Free Action to being reduced to
0 HP by any means, the Zombie can test Endurance at +25
with a TN of 50. If it passes, it instead is only reduced to 1
HP and continues to function as normal. Damage from
weapons with the Crushing trait negate the +25 bonus.
T raits
• Undead
• Diseased (+20):  If this creature deals at least one point of
damage after mitigation to another character with their
natural weapons then that character must test Endurance
+20 or contract a Common Disease.
• Dark Sight: A creature with this trait can see and act normally
in areas with dim or no light.
• Grabbing: A successful hit from a zombie automatically
initiates a Grapple.
• Swarm:  A zombie gains +1 damage for each other zombie
within Reach of the target.
• Resistance (Frost, 2)
• Resistance (Magic, 1)
• Weakness (Fire, 3)
"…a decayed servant may be raised many times, even if they
have been dismembered by those who do not appreciate our
Art. If one of your servants comes to an unfortunate end, you
may raise the servant again by carefully gathering as many
parts as you can find…"
                                         - On the Preparation of the CorpseEncountering Zombies
Zombies are what a commoner thinks of when they envision
necromancy. They are generally encountered either naked or
sparsely clothed, with visible wounds and openings rotted into
their chest and abdomen. If a corpse is fresh enough, it could
even pass as a living creature, given thick enough clothes and a
particularly convincing master. They are cheap for necromancers
to produce since they do not require weapons like a skeleton;
only some magicka and a corpse with most of its flesh intact.
Though able to move via magic, their rotted forms make them
frail and weak. As such, they are often used by necromancers
in swarms, overwhelming their foes in a horde of gouging digits
and flailing appendages.
Loot
• A character can attempt a +0 Alchemy test during a Short
Rest to harvest a dose of Mort Flesh, which is an Uncommon
Destruction ingredient. If the character fails this test, they
instead contract Common Disease.Characteristics Attributes Skills

115Dread Zombie
Dread Zombies are more powerful undead corpses raised by
necromancers, serving as fetid enforcers of their will.

with a TN of 75. If it passes, it instead is only reduced to 1
HP and continues to function as normal. Damage from

• Diseased (+0, Astral Vapors): If this creature deals at least

• Dark Sight: A creature with this trait can see and act normally
in areas with dim or no light.
• Grabbing: A successful hit from a zombie automatically
initiates a Grapple.
• Swarm:  A zombie gains +1 damage for each other zombie
within Reach of the target.
• Regeneration (5): Characters with this trait heal very quickly.
They may make an Endurance test at the start of each round
to heal 5 HP . This does not count as magical healing unless
applied by some magical source.
• Resistance (Frost, 4)
• Resistance (Magic, 3)
• Weakness (Fire, 2)Encountering Dread Zombies
Despite most being minions that lack individual strength, some
zombies break the mold. Dread Zombies are a particularly
dangerous type of zombie. They are stronger, tougher, some say
even smarter, than the average zombie. The magic that suffuses
their being is also able to slowly heal any wounds acquired after
their creation. Perhaps the most insidious feature of a dread
zombie is a magical blight that infects its tissues called Astral
Vapors.
GMs looking to utilize zombies as foes for a party to face may
consider mixing in a few Dread Zombies into their hordes. This
can add an extra edge players must avoid when fighting these
otherwise weak foes.
