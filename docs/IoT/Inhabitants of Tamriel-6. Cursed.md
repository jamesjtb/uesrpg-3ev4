Vampires
Forced to forever thirst for the blood of mortals, Vampires foul
creatures born of the hateful magics of the Prince of Domination,
Molag Bal. Some are no more than ravenous beasts stalking the
countryside and back alleys for their next victim, while others are
well hidden within the nobility of T amriel and lead luxurious lives.
Their affliction is seen as a curse by most, but some recognize it as
a pathway to incredible, and terrible, power.
Vampire Fledgling
Freshly turned and near-feral, these newly-turned vampires have
an uncontrollable thirst for blood.

• Claws: 1d4; Slashing, Magic; 1m Reach
• Fangs: 1d6; Splitting, Magic, Feed; 1m Reach
Has one of:
• Steel Broadsword:  1d8+1; Slashing; Reach 2m, 1H

• Full Leather Armor: AR 3 / 1 Fire; Medium
• Cloth Cloak: Used to conceal themselves from natural

• Feed (1 AP): The vampire feeds on a restrained, helpless, or
enthralled target as a standard attack with their fangs, re-
gaining HP equal to the damage dealt after mitigation. If a
point of damage is dealt successfully, the target’s Endurance
characteristic is reduced by 10 until after their next long
rest. The vampire can choose to use this ability to Coup de
Grâce the target as long as the conditions are met, in which
case they regain the target’s remaining HP . Doing so costs
2 AP and the vampire cannot take actions until their AP is
refreshed.
• Exsanguinate (2 AP): The vampire can use their fangs to
Coup de Grâce the target as long as the conditions are met,
in which case they regain the target’s remaining HP . After
doing so, the vampire loses any remaining AP for the round.
T raits
• Sun-Scarred (2): Any damage inflicted on a character with
this trait after mitigation by an attack that counts as sunlight
is increased by 2 before calculating the effects of the damage.
If this character is exposed to normal sunlight they lose 1
SP each hour. Cloud cover or other such weather halves the
rate of SP loss. The character must spend an hour in a dark
place before they can remove levels of fatigue/regain SP lost
in this manner.
• Dawn-Cursed (1): While in direct sunlight, the character
suffers 1 damage per round which ignores all damage miti-
gation. If the character covers themselves completely with
clothing and a hood with sufficient coverage, this damage
is reduced to 1 per hour in the sunlight.

Encountering Vampire Fledglings
Often panicked or near-feral, Vampire Fledglings are mortals
unfortunate, or fortunate, enough to have recently succumbed
to a vampiric disease. Many are created unintentionally by more
powerful vampires in the rare instances that their prey survives
and, in these cases, they are often maddened or panicked.
Fledglings lack the grace and tact that their more experienced
kin possess and are more likely to savagely quench their thirst
for blood. They also lack a full grasp of their newfound powers
and are unable to call upon the more powerful abilities that
vampirism grants them.Vampire Fledglings are often the servants of more powerful
vampires, serving a GM as a step-up in difficulty from the
vampire thrall they may also be in control of. In this context,
they may be desperate to prove themselves to their master and
reckless in their attacks against adventurers. Other Fledglings
may stalk the streets of the town or city they call home at night,
looking for their next victim. The savaged corpses of the slain
are all they leave behind to be found when the sun rises, offering
an inquisitive party a potential mystery to solve.

Restoration Ingredient, chosen when the vampire dust is

154Encountering Vampires
More experienced in the foul gifts of their curse, Vampires have
learned to control their powers and use them to further their
own goals. Many Vampires live on the fringes of society, living
as outcasts amongst their own kind and preying upon any
unfortunate mortal who they come across. Others integrate
themselves into Tamrielic society, living relatively normal lives
and feeding in secret. Many Vampires will seek power and
dominion over others, perhaps influenced by Molag Bal’s curse,
and will have a retinue of weak-willed thrall in their service.
While not at the apex of their power, Vampires can still prove
to be a dangerous threat to low-level parties who are unprepared
to face them. They are often smart and selfish, but typically find
themselves living in covens of their own kind in service to a
stronger, more powerful vampire. Others may be upstanding
members of society with a dark secret. In combat, Vampires are
often “spell swords,” using both martial combat and blood-magic
to dispatch their foes.GMs running campaigns involving Vampires should take the
time to consider the context in which their party will face them;
will the party face a cave full of these bloodthirsty undead
outright, or will they instead be investigating mysterious
disappearances and blood-drained bodies with no obvious culprit
in sight? GMs should not be afraid to get creative to make their
Vampires unique and to craft encounters appropriate for their
party or game-style.

tion Ingredient, chosen when the vampire dust is used.

magic damage to a target within 4m, restoring their own
HP by the amount of damage successfully dealt (after any
reduction). If this spell is affected by a reflect spell or effect,
it has no net effect.
• Blood Grasp (1 AP + 10 MP): The vampire forces a target
within a 15m range to make a -10 Str test. On a failure, the
vampire can force the target to move up to 10m closer to
them. This forced movement can trigger Attacks of Oppor-
tunity.
• Shrouding Mist (1 AP + 1 SP): The vampire calls upon the
eternal darkness to cause the surrounding area in a 2 kilo-
meter radius to be consumed by a heavy fog. This imposes
a -10 penalty to all Observe tests and any vampire within
the area has their Dawn-Cursed trait value reduced by 1 for
as long as the fog remains. The fog lasts for 5 hours and
cannot be ended early unless affected by a more powerful
magic. This ability takes five minutes to cast .
• Bat Form (1 AP + 1 SP):  They gain the Flyer (10) trait,
change their size to Tiny (-20 to hit by larger characters or
at range), and reduce their max HP to 5. The effect ends
after 3 rounds unless the character spends 1 SP , which re-
freshes the effect for another 3 rounds. The ability ends
immediately and the vampire reverts to their true form if
the HP is reduced to 0.

Encountering Master Vampires
Charming, seductive, deadly, and domineering, Master Vampires
are near the apex of their power and are amongst the deadliest
foes an adventurer can face. They are almost always accompanied
by a retinue of thrall and lesser vampires who serve their will
without question and seldom face threats alone. When they
must enter the fray, they possess powerful vampiric abilities and
blood magic that can easily make short-work of their foes. Some
will live secluded lives away from society, though never without
some semblance of opulence, while others may live amongst
Tamrielic society as rich and powerful nobles.
Alone they can be a deadly threat for any party unprepared to
face them, but their control of a cadre of thralls, lesser vampires,
and other foul creatures makes them especially dangerous. They
should be outfitted with appropriately powerful equipment,
perhaps as opulent as they are functional, and most Master
Vampires will carry themselves with an aura of superiority. They
typically see all those before them, including player characters,
as beneath them, and will often send their minions to fight their
battles rather than sully themselves against lesser foes. GMs
should not use Master Vampires lightly and they serve best as
the boss-level creatures for a party to face at the end of a quest-
line or dungeon.

158for even the most experienced adventurers. They almost always
control a small army of thralls and lesser vampires, and the
pursuit of their ambitions typically have dire consequences for
mortals.
It is recommended that GMs use Vampire Lords as the ultimate
challenge a party may face during their journeys. GMs should
outfit them with powerful custom weapons, armor, and en-
chanted gear; the provided list of equipment are suggestions,
but GMs should not feel constrained by it. It may be best to
“build-up” a Vampire Lord over the course of a campaign, with
the party steadily fighting tougher and tougher vampiric foes
until finally facing their foul master.
Even alone, the Vampire Lord is an extremely difficult foe for
any party to fight. Their immunity to normal weapons means
that the unprepared party is doomed, and their complete mas-
tery over both Nox Arcana and Hemomancy means they have
powerful magical abilities to call upon in addition to any other
forms of magic they may know. Furthermore, simply being in
the presence of a Vampire Lord can cause a debilitating panic
effect. Their weakness to sunlight is the only chink Vampire
Lords have in their impressive arsenal, so providing parties the
means to exploit this in some way can provide for interesting
encounter design.Loot

159Lycanthropes
Cursed to undergo a harrowing change of form under the influence
of the moons, Lycanthropes are mortals who have been touched by
the powers of  The Huntsman, Hircine. They come in a variety of
shapes and sizes, from swift wolves, strong boars, savage bears, to
even more exotic beasts. They often live on the fringes of T amrielic
society, being almost universally despised, and their condition is
considered a curse by most. Some, however, see the transformation
as a gift and fully give themselves to the beast within.
The profiles in this section can represent the beast form of any
NPC cursed with lycanthropy. In these cases, the GM should
choose a NPC profile from Chapter 3: People to represent the
humanoid form of this character.
Werewolf
As swift as they are savage, these werebeasts often hunt in packs to
ambush any unfortunate mortals that cross their path in the
wilderness of T amriel.

• Natural T oughness (4) , Natural T oughness (2) in non-beast
form.
Special Abilities
• Consume (2 AP): The werewolf consumes part of the corpse
of a dead creature. They regain the consumed creature’s EB.
• Consume Heart (3 AP): The werewolf consumes the heart
of a dead creature. They regain twice the consumed creature’s
EB.
• Latch On (1 SP): If the creature successfully Bites a target
which results in a grapple, it latches on as a free action. As
a result, the grappled character receives a -20 penalty to their
attempts to break free. Alternatively, the grappled target can
instead end the grapple as a free action. In doing so, they
suffer the Bleeding (2) Condition and must test for Disease.T raits
• Silver-Scarred (4) , Silver-Scarred (2) in non-beast form.
• Unnatural Senses (Smell, 6) , Unnatural Senses (Smell, 3)
in non-beast form
• Diseased (-20, Werewolf Lycanthropy)
• Immunity (Disease)
• Restless: The character only restores half the health, magicka,
and stamina they normally would while resting.
• Dark Sight
• Quadruped
• Strong Jaws: A Bite attack made by this character that deals
damage automatically starts a Grapple. The test to contest
this Grapple is made against the original test made by the
attacker. If the target Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the
Counter Attack ignores the creature’s AR and Natural
Toughness trait.
• Bestial Leap: Penalties from jumping are halved.
• Savage: Rolls damage twice and uses the highest result.
Encountering Werewolves
By far the most common form of lycanthrope found across
Tamriel, Werewolves are swift and deadly hunters who often
use stealth to ambush their prey. They often form packs of their
own kind, away from greater T amrielic society, and these typically
become tightly-knit clans who hunt alongside one another. This
behavior makes them all the more deadly to face; a lone Werewolf
is dangerous, but a pack can easily be overwhelming even for
experienced hunters. Werewolves are feared across Tamriel, and
many rural communities have stories of foul man-wolves killing
children who wander too close to the town’s edge on the night
of a full moon.
GMs using the base Werewolf should be aware of their strengths
and weaknesses; they are stealthy and agile, but generally weaker
than other forms of lycanthrope. Operating in packs, therefore,
can make them much harder foes for a party to encounter. The
social stigma related to lycanthropy can also lead some to try
and hide their affliction, while others may fully embrace the
“gifts” of Lord Hircine, providing interesting quest-making
opportunities for the creative GM. In any case, a well-equipped
party with silver weapons should be able to take on a Werewolf,
or even a small pack of them. However, Werewolf-hunters
should be mindful that they don’t contract a lycanthropic disease
themselves!
Loot
• A character can make a -10 Survival test to skin the beast.
Lycan hide is valued at 500 drakes. Failing the test ruins the
hide, halving its value.
• A character can make a +0 Survival test to remove a Werewolf
Claw from the beast’s hand, which is an uncommon
Destruction ingredient.Characteristics Attributes Skills

160Werewolf Vargr
Older and more experienced than their packmates, they have fully
given themselves to the beast within to become the ultimate ambush
hunter.
Humanoid, Beast, Lycanthrope; Extreme; Black
Soul (1500)
Weapons and Armor

• Consume Heart (3 AP): The werewolf consumes the heart
of a dead creature. They regain four times the consumed
creature’s EB.
• Latch On (1 SP): If the creature successfully Bites a target
which results in a grapple, it latches on as a free action. As
a result, the grappled character receives a -20 penalty to their
attempts to break free. Alternatively, the grappled target can
instead end the grapple as a free action. In doing so, they
suffer the Bleeding (2) Condition and must test for Disease.
• Thrill of the Chase (Once per round): Uses the Dash Action
to move towards  an enemy without spending AP .
• Call of the Wolf (Once per day):  As a Primary Action, the
werewolf howls. All who can hear within 20m must make
a +10 panic test.T raits

attacker. If the target Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the
Counter Attack ignores the creature’s AR and Natural
Toughness trait.
• Bestial Leap: Penalties from jumping are halved.
• Savage: Rolls damage twice and uses the highest result.
Encountering Werewolve Vargrs
Stronger, faster, and more deadly than the average werewolf,
Werewolf Vargr’s often take on the form of pack-leaders amongst
their kind. They have fully given themselves to the beast within,
guiding less-experienced members of their pack to more fully
embrace Hircine’s gifts. Werewolf Vargrs are experienced and
deadly foes, representing the pinnacle of swift and agile ambush
hunters amongst their kind.
GMs should consider using Werewolf Vargrs as pack leaders,
rather than having them be encountered on their own. While
faster and stronger than the average werewolf, their true ferocity
is unlocked when fighting alongside others of their kind. The
creative GM may want to make a Werewolf Vargr unique,
especially if they play a prominent role in a quest or campaign.
A silvered mane, scars, or missing teeth can make such a creature
stand out from the rest and provide a party of werewolf-hunters
an ultimate prize to pursue.
Loot
• A character can make a -10 Survival test to skin the beast.
Lycan hide is valued at 500 drakes. Failing the test ruins the
hide, halving its value.
• A character can make a +0 Survival test to remove a Werewolf
Vargr Claw from the beast’s hand, which is a Very Rare
Destruction ingredient.Characteristics Attributes Skills

161"I accepted this curse at a young age. I was impressionable. My packleader was a family friend and elder in our village. I wanted
to be strong, and I relished the strength the curse gave me. I would not have called it a curse, then. But with youth comes reckless-
ness, and I was not good at disguising what I was. Eventually they discovered my true nature, and I was driven from the village
My packleader failed me. He did not protect me. He cared too much about his own status to risk it for my sake. I was alone. Ev-
erywhere I went I heard the shouts of crowds, saw the bright torches of the angry mob. I never lingered long in one place before my
secret was discovered.”

Hardy, unpredictable, and hard to take-down, these man-boars are
known to gore their victims with their sharp tusks before devouring
them.

form.
Special Abilities
• Consume (2 AP): The wereboar consumes part of the corpse
of a dead creature. They regain the consumed creature’s EB.
• Consume Heart (3 AP): The wereboar consumes the heart
of a dead creature. They regain twice the consumed creature’s
EB
• Gore (1 SP): As part of a successfully damaging attack with
their tusks, the wereboar can spend a Stamina Point to im-
mediately deal a bonus SB damage.

Toughness trait.
• Bestial Leap: Penalties from jumping are halved.
• Savage: Rolls damage twice and uses the highest result.Encountering Wereboars
Most commonly found amongst the forests and craggy-mountains
of High Rock and Hammerfell, Wereboars are possessed of
thick skin, sharp tusks, and extreme aggression. While they will
sometimes attempt to ambush their prey, Wereboars typically
attempt to overwhelm their victims with sheer brute strength.
They shake-off blows that would kill other creatures with ease,
and are known to ignore horrific wounds in pursuit of a kill.
While groups of Wereboars do sometimes form loose packs,
they are most often found by themselves.
GMs who want their parties to encounter Wereboars should
consider where the party is on Tamriel; Wereboars are uncom-
mon outside of High Rock and the mountainous regions of
Hammerfell, so if the party is to encounter one outside of these
regions some thought as to why the beast is there may be useful.
Furthermore, the Wereboar’s sheer endurance and high natural
toughness can make them very hard to take down, especially if
the party lacks silver weapons. Only parties outfitted for a
lengthy, brutal fight have a chance at taking one of these ill-
tempered beasts down.

• Magic Resistant: Re-rolls failed tests to resist Magic.
• Thick Skull: Immune to the Stun and Dazed conditions.
• Aspect of Tenacity: Penalties from passive wound effects
are halved.
Encountering Wereboar Gore-T usks
Stronger and more aggressive than the common Wereboar,
Wereboar Gore-T usks are worthy opponents for even the most
experienced and well-equipped monster hunters. Like the com-
mon Wereboar, Gore-Tusks are powerhouses on the field pf
battle and prefer to meet their foes head-on, overwhelming
them with sheer strength and resistance to damage.
Their rarity outside of High Rock & Hammerfell, their
exceptionally high natural toughness, and the sheer strength of
their traits should give any GM who wishes to use this creature
at their table pause. Gore-Tusks will make short work of an
ill-equipped or low-level party as they can simply shrug-off most
attacks, and even those attacks that do connect are unlikely to
cause a wound. As with the standard variant, only parties out-
fitted for a lengthy, brutal fight have a chance at taking one of
these ill-tempered beasts down.

Encountering Werebears
Possessed of great strength and a savage temperament, Werebears
stalk the northern of Tamriel. Werebears are a rare sight outside
of Skyrim and the islands to it’s north, and even amongst those
lands these beasts are almost thought to be folklore. Some say
they roam in packs, others say that canis root, a herb native to
Skyrim, can be used to ward them off, and yet others still deny
their existence entirely. However, experienced northern hunters
know these beasts are no myth, and know that to encounter
one often means certain death.
Players who come across these beasts should be prepared for a
hard fight. While not as tough as a Wereboar or as fast as a
Werewolf, Werebears possess a thick hide and powerful natural
weapons. Their natural toughness is enough to soak up many
attacks, while their fangs and claws can make short work of the
ill-prepared adventurer. GM’s should also make note of the
Vicious trait Werebears have, which can make their attacks do
even more damage than would otherwise be expected.
For a low-level party, Werebears can be deadly, and they can
prove challenging for even well-seasoned adventurers. A GM
who wants to use these beasts at their table should consider
these when designing encounters that involve these creatures.
Loot
• A character can make a -10 Survival test to skin the beast.
Lycan hide is valued at 500 drakes. Failing the test ruins the
hide, halving its value.
• A character can make a +0 Survival test to remove a Werebear

• Might of the Bear: When the werebear makes an attack

if the die result (before bonuses) is 11, or Damaged (2) if
the die result is 12.
Encountering Werebear Brutes
While the more common Werebear is a deadly foe, Werebear
Brutes are terrifying forces of nature who can make short work
of even the most seasoned adventurers. Some of these hulking
beasts stalk the frozen north of Tamriel alone, while others lead
packs of their kind to terrorize remote villages. They are relentless
hunters and possessed of powerful natural weapons, allowing
them to tackle even the most powerful of quarry with relative
ease.
A GM who wishes to use the Werebear Brute at their table
should first consider how well-equipped their party is. These
creatures get a flat +2 to damage rolls made with their natural
weapons, Maul gives them an edge against groups of adventurers,
and Aspect of Strength can be used to make their already for-
midable attacks even deadlier. Furthermore, Might of the Bear
ensures that even well-armored foes quickly find their armor
failing them when fighting this beast.
Like the Werewolf Vargr and Werebear Gore-Tusk, Werebear
Brutes are best used as boss-type foes or as a great challenge for
a roving band of experienced beast-hunters to overcome.
