14Bears
Bear
Bears are large ursine quadrupeds that are widespread and ubiquitous 
in temperate and arctic regions. They are typically large and capable 
of crushing an armored man.
Bear, Beast; Average; White Soul (250)
Weapons and Armor
• Claws: 1d12 Crushing or Splitting; Reach 1m
• Bite: 1d10 Crushing; Reach 1m
• Natural T oughness (3)
Special Abilities
• Maul (1 AP + 2 SP): The bear performs a melee attack as 
a Primary Action that deals 2d8 Crushing damage to a target 
creature within 1 meter. Additionally, all creatures within 
reach that are Medium or smaller must succeed on an Ac-
robatics or Athletics test or be knocked prone.
T raits
• Bestial
• Strong Jaws: A Bite attack made by this character that deals 
damage automatically starts a Grapple. The test to contest 
this Grapple is made against the original test made by the 
attacker. If the target Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the 
Counter Attack ignores the creature’s AR and Natural 
Toughness trait.
• Diseased (+0): If the creature successfully deals damage to 
an undiseased target with their natural weapons, the target 
creature must succeed on a +0 Endurance test or contract a 
Common Disease.
• Quadruped
Variant: Cave Bear
Traits
• Dark Sight
• Stubborn: The creature may re-roll failed Fear tests.Encountering Bears
Bears are often found in their dens or roaming in search of food. 
They frequent temperate or evergreen woodlands, though their 
adaptable nature allows them to thrive in many climates. During 
winter, bears will be found almost exclusively in their dens with 
the exception of Snow Bears which will continue to roam and 
hunt during the cold season, but will be far less active. Bears 
are sometimes accompanied by their cubs, which they will 
defend with their lives. 
Bears will become very territorial and aggressive unless the target 
is obviously superior or causes Fear. If the bear wins the fight, 
they will typically leave their opponent alone, bleeding and 
battered after they are convinced the threat is subdued, and 
don’t tend to eat humans unless desperate. Bears will relentlessly 
pursue their prey, and can run on all fours nearly as fast as a 
horse.
Loot
• On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the bear’s 
pelt, worth 100 drakes, over the course of a Short Rest. This 
pelt has an ENC of 2. Failing this test spoils the pelt, halving 
its worth.
• On a +20 Survival test, a character can, over the course of 
a Long Rest, turn a bear pelt into two limb pieces of Full 
Bear Fur armor or one Full Bear Fur chest piece. Bear Fur 
armor is the same as regular Fur but has 4 AR. Failing spoils 
the pelt instead, making it useless and halving its worth.
• On a +20 Simple Survival test over a Long Rest, a character 
can harvest DoS x 3 days' rations of bear meat. The meat 
will spoil within a day if not properly preserved.
• On a +0 Alchemy test over a Short Rest, a character can 
harvest and powder the bear’s claws, which are a Rare 
Alteration ingredient. The character harvests DoS dosages.Characteristics Attributes Skills

15Snow Bear
Covered in stark-white fur and larger than their southern cousins, 
Snow Bears can be found roaming the frozen tundras and craggy 
glaciers of T amriel’s northernmost provinces. They are stronger and 
more aggressive than other varieties of bear.

Encountering Snow Bears
Snow bears can be found roaming the frozen tundras and 
glacier-filled ravines of Tamriel’s northernmost provinces and 
islands. They roam these frozen lands year-round and, due to 
the harsh conditions in which they live, these animals will sel-
dom give up an opportunity to make a kill. Unlike their southern 
cousins, they will eat men or mer they bring down and will 
guard the carcasses of their prey ferociously.
Snow bears will become very territorial and aggressive unless 
the target is obviously superior or causes Fear. These bears will 
relentlessly pursue their prey, and can run on all fours nearly as 
fast as a horse despite their great size.
Loot
• On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the bear’s 
pelt, worth 200 drakes, over the course of a Short Rest.This 
pelt has an ENC of 2. Failing this test spoils the pelt, halving 
its worth.
• On a +20 Survival test, a character can, over the course of 
a Long Rest, turn a bear pelt into two limb pieces of Full 
Snow Bear Fur armor, or one Full Snow Bear Fur chest piece. 
Bear Fur armor is exactly the same as regular Fur but has 4 
AR and gives 4 Frost AR. Failing this test spoils the pelt 
instead, rendering it useless and halving its worth.
• On a +20 Simple Survival test over a Long Rest, a character 
can harvest DoS x 3 days' rations of bear meat. The meat 
will spoil within a day if not properly preserved.
• On a +0 Alchemy test over a Short Rest, a character can

16Rats
Cave Rat
Cave rats are a plague upon the common folk of T amriel. Found 
in virtually every province, individually they are weak but collec-
tively they can bring down a fully-armored man.
Rat, Beast; T rivial; White Soul (10)
Weapons and Armor
• Claws & T eeth: 1d4 Slashing, Reach 1m
Special Abilities
• Rat Leap (1 AP + 1 SP): The rat leaps up to 3m and makes 
a biting attack as a primary action against the target. Dodging 
or Parrying the attack has a -20 penalty as the rat catches 
them off-guard.
T raits
• Bestial
• Dark Sight
• Diseased (-30): If the creature successfully deals damage to 
an undiseased target with their natural weapons, then the 
target creature must succeed on a -30 Endurance test or 
contract a Common Disease.
• QuadrupedEncountering Cave Rats
Cave Rats are most commonly encountered in caves, however 
they can also be found in dungeons, sewers, and various other 
subterranean pits and places. They are harbingers of disease and 
decay, and wherever civilization goes, Cave Rats tend to follow. 
Cave Rats are notoriously aggressive in spite of their diminutive 
size and feeble strength, which makes them a danger to societies 
small and large. Purging rat dens is a quintessential adventurer’s 
quest, and rat-killer is a perfectly reasonable career in large cities 
like Mournhold or Whiterun.
Cave Rats are defensive in their dens, and aggressively raid 
settlements, typically during the night, for anything they can 
eat. When fought, rats tend to flee when they realize they are 
in danger, but they are just as likely to be recklessly courageous, 
throwing themselves at their opponent with reckless abandon 
without awareness the mortal danger they are in. 
Should a population of Cave Rats flee their den they will typically 
regroup and create a new den quickly.
Loot
• On a +30 Survival test, a character can harvest one day's 
ration of rat meat. Rat meat must be cooked, and consuming 
it forces a +0 Endurance test, causing the consuming char-
acter to gain a Common Disease on a failure.
• A character can harvest the rat's tail, which is a Common 
Destruction ingredient.
"You can't imagine the fuss some people make. My rats are 
no problem for anyone."

17Skeever
Larger and more aggressive than the common Cave Rat, Skeevers 
carry virulent diseases and can be dangerous to even the most hard-
ened adventurers when fought en-masse.
Rat, Beast; T rivial; Soul T ype (15)
Weapons and Armor
• Claws & T eeth: 1d4 Slashing, Reach 1m
Special Abilities
• Rat Leap (1 AP + 1 SP): The rat leaps up to 3m and makes 
a biting attack as a primary action against the target. Dodging 
or Parrying the attack has a -20 penalty as the rat catches 
them off-guard.

• Quadruped
• Strong Jaws: A Bite attack made by this character that deals 
damage automatically starts a Grapple. The test to contest 
this Grapple is made against the original test made by the 
attacker. If the target Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the 
Counter Attack ignores the creature’s AR and Natural 
Toughness trait.Encountering Skeevers
Skeevers are dog-sized vermin that can be found inhabiting dark 
caves and fetid sewers across the continent. While less common 
than their Cave Rat cousins, they are more dangerous and are 
more likely to spread the diseases they carry to anyone unfortunate 
enough to cross paths with them.
These oversized rats are even more aggressive than Cave Rats, 
requiring city-guards or even dedicated rat-slayers to flush these 
warrens out. When fought, Skeevers will fight even fully grown 
men when in small groups, but alone they will often flee to the 
safety of the dark, damp places they call home if the threat is 
too great. Much like their smaller cousins, they can often be 
suicidally courageous in small groups and will throw themselves 
at their opponent with reckless abandon with little regard for 
the mortal danger they are in.
If flushed from their den, surviving Skeevers will often establish 
new colonies which will continue to plague whatever town or 
city they reside in.
Loot
• On a +30 Survival test, a character can harvest one day's 
ration of skeever meat. Skeever meat must be cooked, and 
consuming it forces a -10 Endurance test, causing the con-
suming character to contract a Common Disease on a failure.
• A character can harvest the skeever's tail, which is an 
Uncommon Destruction ingredient.Characteristics Attributes Skills

18Crocodile
Crocodiles are large, aquatic reptiles found in many of the southern 
regions of T amriel.
Beast; Average; Soul T ype (200)
Weapons and Armor
• Bite: 1d10; Crushing; Reach 1m
• Scales: Partial AR 3
Special Abilities
• Thrash (1 SP): If the crocodile successfully Bites a target, 
it can spend a Stamina as a free action to Thrash the target. 
This deals 1d10+3 damage that ignores armor. If underwater, 
the target must pass a +0 Endurance test or be dropped to 
0 HP as they drown.
T raits
• Amphibious: Can breath water and ignores the skill cap 
placed on their Combat rolls by their Athletics when fighting 
in water.
• Bestial
• Dark Sight
• Diseased (+0): If the creature successfully deals damage to 
an undiseased target with their natural weapons, then the 
target creature must succeed on a +0 Endurance test or con-
tract a Common Disease.
• Savage: Rolls damage twice and uses the highest result.
• Strong Jaws: A Bite attack made by this character that deals 
damage automatically starts a Grapple. The test to contest 
this Grapple is made against the original test made by the 
attacker. If the target Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the 
Counter Attack ignores the creature’s AR and Natural 
Toughness trait.
• Weak Point (Underbelly): This creature’s AR is not applied 
to its underbelly. Precision Strikes can be made targeting 
this location in addition to the standard hit locations.Encountering Crocodiles
Crocodiles can be found in the warmer southern climes of 
Tamriel, most commonly in Black Marsh and in the wetlands 
surrounding Leyawiin. Crocodiles are large reptilian predators 
that can hold their breath for significant periods of time, using 
this trait to ambush unwary prey passing near the water’s edge.
While they don’t normally hunt men or me crocodiles will attack 
nearly anything that comes too close. Their jaws snap with such 
pressure that they easily breaks bones and these creatures can 
quickly drown targets by thrashing them about underwater. 
Even if one does survive a crocodile attack, it is not uncommon 
for their victims to lose limbs in the process as the force of their 
bites can often shear limb from body.
Crocodiles often have bounties put on their heads when they 
encroach too close to civilization, because of the danger they 
pose to unsuspecting travelers who may find themselves rapidly 
pulled into a nearby body of water and killed.
Loot
• On a +0 Survival test, a character can remove the crocodile's 
hide, worth 100 drakes, over the course of a Long Rest. If 
the character fails the test, they spoil the hide, halving its 
worth.
• On a +10 Survival test, a character can, over the course of 
a Long Rest, turn a crocodile hide into one piece of Full 
Crocodile Hide armor. Crocodile Hide armor is exactly the 
same as regular Hide but has 3 AR and is waterproof. It 
takes two crocodile hides to make a Crocodile Hide chest 
piece. If the character fails the test, they spoil the hide, failing 
to craft the armor and halving the hide's worth.
• On a successful +20 Simple Survival test over a Short Rest, 
a character can butcher a crocodile for meat. A character 
prepares DoS x 2 days' rations worth of crocodile meat. The 
meat will spoil within a day if not properly preserved.
• On a +0 Alchemy test, a character can harvest the crocodile's 
eyes, which are a Rare Mysticism ingredient. If the character 
scores more than 3 DoS, they harvest two eyes instead.Characteristics Attributes Skills

19Dogs
Dog
Dogs both wild and domesticated can be found across T amriel. They 
are “man’s best friend” are commonly used as companion and work 
animals.
Dog, Beast; Minor; White Soul (100)
Weapons and Armor
• Bite: 1d6; Slashing; Reach 1m
Special Abilities
• Latch On (1 SP): If the creature successfully Bites a target 
which results in a grapple, it latches on as a free action. As 
a result, the grappled character receives a -20 penalty to their 
attempts to break free. Alternatively, the grappled target can 
instead end the grapple as a free action. In doing so, they 
suffer the Bleeding (2) Condition and must test for Disease.
T raits
• Bestial
• Dark Sight
• Diseased (+0): If the creature successfully deals damage to 
an undiseased target with their natural weapons, then the 
target creature must succeed a +0 Endurance test or contract 
a Common Disease.
• Man’ s Best Friend: Even though it cannot speak any languages, 
a dog can understand simple orders given by a character it 
trusts.
• Quadruped
• Strong Jaws : A Bite attack made by this character that deals 
damage automatically starts a Grapple. The test to contest 
this Grapple is made against the original test made by the 
attacker. If the target Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the 
Counter Attack ignores the creature’s AR and Natural 
Toughness trait.Encountering Dogs
Dogs can be found all across Tamriel. Domesticated dogs can 
be found in and around nearly all human settlements, and have 
followed mankind in their journeys ever since they came down 
from Atmora. They range from friendly to belligerent, and will, 
like most beasts, fiercely defend their young. They can be be-
friended and trained with relative ease, and many across Tamriel 
make their living breeding and training dogs for a variety of 
uses.
Wild dogs can be encountered roaming the warmer climates, 
most commonly in packs that wander Hammerfell and Elsweyr, 
fulfilling much the same niche as wolves. These dogs hunt in 
large packs and are aggressive, especially towards the weak or 
wounded. Although they do not often hunt men or mer, 
desperation can lead wild dogs to hunt down and attempt to 
kill those traveling the wilds of Tamriel.
Loot
• On a +0 Survival test, a character can remove the dog's pelt, 
worth 5 drakes, over the course of a Short Rest. Skinning a 
domestic dog is considered a cruel act in most of Tamriel, 
and in some places is also a crime.
• On a +30 Simple Survival test over a Short Rest, a character 
can harvest DoS days' rations of dog meat. The meat will 
spoil within a day if not properly preserved. Additionally, 
harvesting a domesticated dog's meat is typically considered 
cruel and may be criminal.Characteristics Attributes Skills

20War Dog
Some dogs have been bred to join their masters in battle. They are 
stronger, faster, and more deadly than their domestic cousins and 
will respond to the commands of their master without hesitation, 
no matter the situation.

• Bite: 1d6; Slashing; Reach 1m
Special Abilities

tract a Common Disease.
• Man’ s Best Friend: Even though it cannot speak any languages, 
a dog can understand simple orders given by a character it 
trusts.
• Quadruped
• Teamwork:  Gains a bonus DoS on any attack rolls made 
while an ally with Teamwork is in Reach of the same target.
• Strong Jaws : A Bite attack made by this character that deals 
damage automatically starts a Grapple. The test to contest 
this Grapple is made against the original test made by the 
attacker. If the target Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the 
Counter Attack ignores the creature’s AR and Natural 
Toughness trait.
• Stubborn:  Can re-roll failed Panic tests.
• Unrelenting:  Targets cannot Disengage while in Reach of 
a War Dog.Encountering War Dogs
While common dogs can be found across the continent in both 
domestic and wild forms, War Dogs are almost exclusively found 
in the possession of soldiers and guards. War Dogs have no wild 
counterparts and thus have lost many of their natural instincts 
beyond those they have been bred to possess. These dogs are 
fiercely loyal to their masters and will fight to the death on their 
behalf, obeying any commands given without hesitation and 
using their increased strength and lethality to great effect against 
those unfortunate enough to face them.
It is not uncommon to find a pair of guards accompanied by a 
War Dog as they patrol the streets of a city or for a hardened 
warrior to be accompanied by the dog they served with in 
conflicts past. They can also be found in the possession of the 
many ne'er-do-wells across Tamriel, used to intimidate or 
eviscerate any who cross them. In short, War Dogs are almost 
always encountered alongside their masters and this combination 
of warrior and canine is a truly potent force for any adventurer 
to face.
Loot
• On a +0 Survival test, a character can remove the War Dog's 
pelt, worth 5 drakes, over the course of a Short Rest. Skinning 
a domestic dog is considered a cruel act in most of Tamriel, 
and in some places is also a crime.
• On a +30 Simple Survival test over a Short Rest, a character 
can harvest DoS days' rations of dog meat. The meat will 
spoil within a day if not properly preserved. Additionally, 
harvesting a domesticated dog's meat is typically considered

Encountering Dreughs
Dreugh are a mysterious and esoteric beast-peoples that live in 
underground lairs and sunken ruins. They appear half man, 
half octopus, with the claws of crabs. Dreugh can be found in 
any of the saltwater seas surrounding Tamriel, and frequent the 
waterways of the Iliac Bay.
Their origins are shrouded in legend, though some say the 
Dreugh are the remnants of a prehistoric civilization that spanned 
the seas, who lived in castles of glass and coral. The ancient 
Chimer waged frequent war against the Dreugh, to which some 
attribute the species’ devolved intelligence and collapsed empire.
Others still suggest that Dreugh ruled the world in an even 
older time, when the world was all seas and Lyg, and Molag Bal 
served as their chief.
Loot
• On a +0 Survival test, a character can remove the Dreugh's 
shell, worth 150 drakes, over the course of a Long Rest. 
Failing this test spoils the shell, halving its worth.

Chest pieces. Failing this test instead spoils the shell, halving 
its worth.
• On a -10 Alchemy test over a Short Rest, a character can 
harvest the wax from the Dreugh's shell, which is an Very 
Rare Restoration ingredient. The character can only ever 
manage to salvage a single dose.Characteristics Attributes Skills

22Land Dreugh
For one year of their life, dreughs undergo karvinasim and emerge 
onto land as aggressive crustaceans to breed. During this period 
they are known as land dreughs (or “billies”).

Once in their lifetime, for a single year, Dreugh undergo 
metamorphosis called karvinasim and emerge onto land as 
violent crustaceans, with many legs and extra appendages, 
adapted for surface hunting. Land Dreugh, unlike their depth 
dwelling kin, are highly aggressive and very dangerous. With 
hard armor, and large, raking talons, Land Dreugh emerge onto 
land to hunt and mate for a brief time. 
Land Dreugh can be found on many large beaches, and will 
gather into colonies that will hunt indiscriminately for miles 
around their beach-colony. Whole villages have been wiped out 
by Land Dreugh, who capture or kill the inhabitants to feed 
their freshly spawned younglings.
In combat, Land Dreugh will fight to win, using all of their 
cunning and brutality to their advantage, and if in the proper 
numbers, will not hesitate to engage in full scale battles.

• On a +0 Survival test, a character can remove the Dreugh's 
shell, worth 150 drakes, over the course of a Long Rest.
• On a +0 Survival test, a character can, over the course of a

23Durzog
Sometimes called sludgepuppies, a durzog is a dog-like reptilian 
creature used in battle by goblins and orcs.
Beast; Average; White Soul (200)
Weapons and Armor
• Bite: 1d10; Crushing (2); Reach 1m
• Scaled Hide: Partial AR 5 / Poison 1
Special Abilities
• Latch On (1 SP): If the creature successfully Bites a target 
which results in a grapple, it latches on as a free action. As 
a result, the grappled character receives a -20 penalty to their 
attempts to break free. Alternatively, the grappled target can 
instead end the grapple as a free action. In doing so, they 
suffer the Bleeding (2) Condition and must test for Disease.
T raits
• Bestial
• Dark Sight
• Diseased (+0): If the creature successfully deals damage to 
an undiseased target with their natural weapons, then the 
target creature must succeed on a +0 Endurance test or con-
tract a Common Disease.
• Greenskin’s Best Friend: Even though it cannot speak any 
languages, a durzog can understand simple orders given by 
a goblin or orc that it trusts.
• Quadruped
• Savage:  Rolls damage twice and uses the highest result.
• Strong Jaws : A Bite attack made by this character that deals 
damage automatically starts a Grapple. The test to contest 
this Grapple is made against the original test made by the 
attacker. If the target Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the 
Counter Attack ignores the creature’s AR and Natural 
Toughness trait.
• Teamwork:  Gains a bonus DoS on any attack rolls made 
while an ally with Teamwork is in Reach of the same target.
• Weak Point (Underbelly): This creature’s AR is not applied 
to its underbelly. Precision Strikes can be made targeting 
this location in addition to the standard hit locations.Variant: War Durzog
Traits
• Stubborn: Can re-roll failed Panic tests
• Trained: War Durzogs ignore the Bestial trait.
• Unrelenting:  Targets cannot use the Disengage action while 
in the War Durzog’s melee range.
Encountering Durzogs
Durzogs are hound-like reptiles found both in the wild and in 
service of goblins and orcs, especially in the Wrothgarian and 
Dragontail Mountains. Durzogs are large, bulky, and have 
powerful snapping jaws, resembling a crocodiles, but with large 
piercing tusks.
 In the wilderness, durzogs live in small familial packs, usually 
numbering no greater than half a dozen. When tamed and bred 
by greenskins, their packs can be far, far larger, sometimes in 
the hundreds, if the tribe can keep them fed. 
Durzogs will typically live in warrens they dig with their large, 
broad claws, or in existing cave systems, where their night eyes 
allow them to see. They typically hunt at night, and are not 
afraid to hunt men and mer alike. 
Durzogs tend to size up an opponent, then in unison will swarm 
and violently bite and snap at their prey until they can drag it 
to the ground and pull it limb from limb to devour it while it 
is still alive. They eat all of their prey, and do not even leave 
behind the bones.
Loot
• On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the durzog's 
hide, worth 30 drakes, over the course of a Short Rest.
• On a +20 Survival test, a character can, over the course of 
a Long Rest, turn a durzog hide into one piece of Full Durzog 
Hide armor. Durzog Hide armor uses the standard Hide 
armor profile with the addition of 1 Poison AR.
• On a +20 Simple Survival test over a Short Rest, a character 
can harvest DoS days' rations of durzog meat, which can be 
cooked and eaten as a ration, or can be used as an Uncom-
mon Illusion ingredient. Unlike other raw meats, durzog 
meat will not spoil.Characteristics Attributes Skills

24Game Animals
There are many beasts hunted for sport or for meat and hides across 
Tamriel, that don’t typically present a major threat in combat. 
Game Animals are so widely varied, that these profiles should cover 
most varieties with some tweaking.
Small Game
Animals such as rabbits, foxes, squirrels, birds, small lizards, very 
large insects, raccoon, hedgehogs, and fish.
Game, Beast; T rivial; White Soul (5)
Weapons and Armor
• Biting, Pecking, or Clawing: 1d4; Reach 1m

• Natural T oughness (2)
T raits
• BestialVariable T raits
Any game animal may have any of the following traits in any 
combination depending on their species:
• Amphibious: Can breath water and ignores the skill cap 
placed on their Combat rolls by their Athletics when fighting 
in water.
• Dark Sight
• Flyer (Speed x 3)
• Quadruped
• Strong Jaws:  A Bite attack made by this character that deals 
damage automatically starts a Grapple. The test to contest 
this Grapple is made against the original test made by the 
attacker. If the target Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the 
Counter Attack ignores the creature’s AR and Natural 
Toughness trait.
• Swimmer: This creature doubles its movement speed in 
water.
Encountering Game Animals
Game Animals of all sorts can be found across Tamriel, and are 
most commonly hunted for their meat, pelts or trophies. This 
entry is mostly to aid in characters hunting for rations in their 
downtime, and can be tailored to represent something as large 
as a moose or as small as a mouse.
Loot
• On a +20 Survival test, a character can remove the game 
animal's hide. It takes a Short Rest to remove the pelt of a 
Small Game animal, worth 10 drakes. It takes a Long Rest 
to remove the pelt of a Large Game animal, worth 100 
drakes. Failing the test spoils the hide, halving its worth.
• On a +20 Survival test, a character can create one piece of 
Partial Hide or Fur armor using a Small hide, or one piece 
of Full Hide or Fur armor using a Large Hide (or two Partial 
pieces) over a Long Rest.
• On a +40 Survival test, a character can remove a trophy 
from a Large Game animal over a Short Rest, worth 100 
drakes.
• On a +30 Simple Survival test, a character can harvest meat 
from a Game Animal. They gain DoS / 2 rations of meat 
from a Small Game animal which takes a Short Rest, and 
DoS x 3 rations of meat from a Large Game animal which 
takes a Long Rest. The meat will spoil if not preserved.Characteristics Attributes Skills

25Giant
Giants are enormous humanoids with a primitive culture, hailing 
from Atmora.
Beast; Major; White Soul (800)
Weapons and Armor
• Giant Club: 3d10; Crushing, Unwieldy, Shieldsplitter, 
Concussive; Reach 2-4m, 1H
• Natural T oughness (2)
• Mammoth Fur Armor: AR 3 / Frost 2; Light, Partial; Body 
and Legs
Special Abilities
• Overhead Slam (1 AP + 3 SP): The giant can, as part of a 
melee attack, make an overhead slam. This is a 4m line 
originating from the giant. This is resolved as an AoE. Any 
target that is hit is immediately thrown a number of meters 
vertically equal to the damage they receive. They then suffer 
the consequences of falling as usual.
• Sweeping Strike (1 AP + 1 SP): The giant can, as part of a 
melee attack, make a sweeping strike, which hits up to 5 
targets in the giant's Reach. This is resolved as an AoE.
T raits
• Colossal Strikes: Cannot be parried, but targets gain a +10 
on tests to Evade its melee attacks.
• Magic Resistant: Re-rolls failed tests to resist Magic.
• Stubborn: Re-rolls failed Panic tests.
• Thick Skull: Immune to the Stun and Dazed conditions.
Special Hit T ableEncountering Giants
Giants are a semi-intelligent nomadic race native to Skyrim and 
High Rock. Giants speak in a deep, guttural language that no 
one since the days of Atmora remembers how to speak. They 
wear clothing made of furs and bones. A giant’s tools and 
weapons are often made from oversized rock, logs, and scrimshawed 
mammoth bones. 
Giants stand 11-12 feet tall, and female giants are rarely, if ever, 
seen. It is speculated that female giants are kept living in the 
mountains while the nomadic males range about during the 
summer months, only to return to the mountaintops in winter 
after having grazed their mammoth herds for the season, which 
they have domesticated and shepherd. Giants are highly terri-
torial and protective of their mammoths, and will often attack 
those who stray too near their encampments. In combat, giants 
use their massive strength to crush their enemies. 
Giants have demonstrated complex beliefs concerning death. 
When a giant is sick or dying, they make pilgrimage to one of 
their sacred burial grounds to die alone.
Loot
• A character can salvage Mammoth Cheese from the giant's 
pouch. The character searching can salvage up to d4 rations 
of the rancid cheese. It requires a +0 Endurance test to keep 
down.
• A character can remove Giant Toes, which are a Very Rare 
Restoration Ingredients. The character salvages up to two 
toes - the rest are simply too small.
• A character can wield the Giant's Club using the stats 
presented in its profile. Use by a regular PC requires at least 
50 Strength, must be used in two hands, and requires a 
Stamina Point each time its wings. It has ENC 10.
• On a +10 Survival test, a character can turn giant bones into 
weapons or armor. Giant bones are exactly like regular Bone 
equipment, but lose the Primitive trait. Additionally, Giant 
Bone armor increases its AR and ENC by 1.Characteristics Attributes Skills

27Giant Bat
Large bats, roughly the size of the average dog.
Beast; T rivial; White Soul (50)
Weapons and Armor
• Bite: 1d6; Slashing; Reach 1m
Special Abilities
• Drink Blood (1 SP): If the Giant Bat deals damage to a 
target using its Vampiric Fangs, it can immediately spend a 
Stamina Point to heal for 1d10 HP as a free action. This 
may not exceed its HP maximum.
T raits
• Bestial
• Dark Sight
• Diseased (-20): If the creature successfully deals damage to 
an undiseased target with their natural weapons, the target 
creature must succeed on a -20 Endurance test or contract 
a Common Disease.
• Echolocation: A Giant Bat sees by hearing, not by sight. A 
Giant Bat cannot be conventionally Blinded, but is instead 
treated as also being Blind when affected by the Deafened 
condition.
• Flyer (20m): The Giant Bat’s flight speed is 20m.
• Strong Jaws: A Bite attack made by this character that deals 
damage automatically starts a Grapple. The test to contest 
this Grapple is made against the original test made by the 
attacker. If the target Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the 
Counter Attack ignores the creature’s AR and Natural 
Toughness trait.Encountering Giant Bats
Giant bats can be found across Tamriel, in caves and in deep 
woods. Giant bats, much like their smaller cousins, hunt by 
night using high-pitched screeching to echo-locate. Because of 
their larger size, the screeches of giant bats are very much audible 
by the ears of men and mer, and their cries put fear into the 
hearts of travelers, for giant bats are not solitary hunters.
Giant bats, when hunting, will swarm a single target ruthlessly 
with the intent of killing, so they may feed on the body in the 
precious time before dawn, where they can be seen and their 
night-time advantage leaves them. If giant bats are driven off, 
but have done sufficient flesh wounds to a potential target, they 
will return time and again over the course of the night in hit 
and run attacks, depriving their prey of rest.
When attacked in their lairs, bats will swarm viciously as above, 
but will frequently simply flee their nest and return when it is 
safe, unless there are vulnerable young to protect, in which case 
they will fight until the small creatures are able to escape.
Loot
• On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the bat's 
hide, worth 20 drakes, over the course of a Short Rest. Failing 
this test spoils the hide, halving its worth.
• On a +20 Survival test, a character can, over the course of 
a Long Rest, turn a bat hide into one piece of Full Bat Hide 
armor. It requires two bat hides to make a Full Bat Hide 
chest piece. Bat Hide armor is exactly the same as regular 
Hide, but is a cool midnight black color and provides a +10 
bonus to the wearer's Stealth tests if the character is wearing 
at least 4 Bat Hide pieces. Failing this test spoils the hide, 
halving its worth and rendering it useless.
• On a +20 Simple Survival test a character can harvest bat 
meat over a Short Rest. The character harvests DoS days' 
rations. The meat will spoil within a day if not preserved.
• On a -10 Alchemy test over a Short Rest, a character can 
prepare the bat's fangs, which are a Rare Destruction ingre-
dient. Scoring 2 or more DoS harvests 2 fangs instead.Characteristics Attributes Skills

28Giant Snake
Enormous, deadly snakes. Often found near water.
Beast; Minor; White Soul (80)
Weapons and Armor
• Bite: 1d8; Slashing; Reach 1m
• Snake Hide: AR 2 / Poison 1; Full
• Weak Point (Underbelly): This creature’s AR is not applied 
to its underbelly. Precision Strikes can be made targeting 
this location in addition to the standard hit locations.
Special Abilities
• Constrict (1 AP + 1 SP): If an enemy is Grappled, the Snake 
can cause them to lose 2 SP as a Secondary Action.
• Envenom (1 SP): After successfully dealing damage with a 
Bite attack, the Giant Snake deals an additional 1d6 Poison 
damage as a Free Action.
T raits
• Amphibious: Can breath water and ignores the skill cap 
placed on their Combat rolls by their Athletics when fighting 
in water.
• Bestial
• Crawler: This creature is not slowed by difficult terrain.
• Dark Sight
• Diseased (+0): If the creature successfully deals damage to 
an undiseased target with their natural weapons, the target 
creature must succeed on a +0 Endurance test or contract a 
Common Disease.
• Serpentine: Attacks which target the Arm or Leg hit locations 
are resolved against the body instead.
• Strong Jaws: A Bite attack made by this character that deals 
damage automatically starts a Grapple. The test to contest 
this Grapple is made against the original test made by the 
attacker. If the target Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the 
Counter Attack ignores the creature’s AR and Natural 
Toughness trait.Encountering Giant Snakes
Giant snakes can be found in both the wet and dry regions of 
Tamriel. Giant snakes tend to prey on large fauna, such as elk, 
deer, and sometimes a foolhardy adventurer.
Giant snakes come in a wide variety of types, some of which 
are deadly poisoners, and some are brutal constrictors. A poi-
sonous giant snake will focus their efforts on envenoming their 
prey, while a constrictor will go in for a squeeze and will not 
stop until their prey is utterly crushed.
Despite their large size, giant snakes are surprisingly stealthy, 
as they move silently and low to the underbrush. This can make 
spotting them hazardous, and in swampy regions, they some-
times swim on the surface of water, or drop down from trees. 
Snakes make semi-permanent burrows they range out of to hunt 
prey. Due to the size of their prey, they do not feed often, as 
they digest their victims whole, a process that takes weeks, 
sometimes months.
Loot
• On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the snake's 
hide, worth 100 drakes, over the course of a Short Rest. 
Failing this test spoils the hide and halves its worth.
• On a +20 Survival test, a character can, over the course of 
a Long Rest, turn a snake hide into one piece of Full Snake 
Hide armor. Alternatively, creating a Full Snake Hide chest 
piece requires two snake hides. Snake Hide armor is exactly 
the same as regular Hide but also provides 1 Poison AR. 
Failing this test spoils the hide, halving its worth, and renders 
it useless.
• On a +20 Simple Survival test over a Short Rest, a character 
can harvest DoS days' rations of snake meat. Snake meat 
will spoil within a day if not preserved.
• On a +20 Alchemy test over a Short Rest, a character can 
harvest and prepare the snake's eyes, which are Uncommon 
Illusion ingredients. If the character scores more than 1 DoS, 
they harvest 2 giant snake eyes instead.
• Additionally, a character can make on roll on the T reasure 
table to see if the snake has swallowed any other adventurers 
and what loot they had.Characteristics Attributes Skills

29Giant Spider
Enormous spiders that lurk in dark caves, and deep within ancient 
forests, spinning webs to catch unsuspecting prey.
Beast; Minor; White Soul (160)
Weapons and Armor
• Bite: 1d6; Slashing; Reach 1m
Special Abilities
• Poison Spray (1 AP + 1 SP):  The spider can spray poison 
at a target up to 10m away as a ranged attack action. It gains 
a +10 to hit and deals 2d6 Poison damage.
• Web Blast (1 AP + 1 SP):  The spider can launch a web up 
to 10m as a ranged attack action. If it hits, the target becomes 
Entangled.
T raits
• Bestial
• Climber:  This creature can climb walls and ceilings as if 
open ground.
• Crawler: This creature is not slowed by difficult terrain.
• Dark Sight
• Diseased (+0): If the creature successfully deals damage to

creature must succeed on a +0 Endurance test or contract a

• Strong Jaws: A Bite attack made by this character that deals 
damage automatically starts a Grapple. The test to contest 
this Grapple is made against the original test made by the 
attacker. If the target Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the 
Counter Attack ignores the creature’s AR and Natural 
Toughness trait.Encountering Giant Spiders
Giant spiders often live in small broods, down in the hidden 
and darkened depths of the underground, or in particularly 
dense forests. Often, there are dozens, or hundreds of smaller 
spiderlings under the command of a larger mother spider, and 
her handful of mates.
Capable of crawling on ceilings and walls, giant spiders weave 
powerful webs to entangle victims, who are then liquefied with 
deadly poison and feasted upon. They will lie in wait to ambush 
larger prey, but are unafraid of charging weaker, man sized prey 
head on. The spiders can also use their deadly venom as projectiles, 
spitting it in large globs to weaken their prey from a distance.
Though giant spiders are ambush hunters, desperation for food 
may drive them to take a more proactive approach to hunting, 
which may result in attacks away from their lair on the road, 
or in small villages. When attacked in their lair, spiders will use 
all of their abilities and defenses to their advantage to hinder 
their foes.
Loot
• On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the spider's 
hide, worth 30 drakes, over the course of a Short Rest. Failing 
this test spoils the hide and halves its worth.
• On a +20 Survival test, a character can, over the course of 
a Long Rest, turn a spider hide into one piece of Full Spider 
Hide armor. Alternatively, creating a Full Spider Hide chest 
piece requires two spider hides. Spider Hide armor is exactly 
the same as regular Hide, but provides a +10 bonus to the 
wearer's Athletics tests made to climb, if the character is 
wearing at least 4 pieces. Failing this test spoils the hide, 
which halves its worth and renders it useless.
• On a +10 Survival test, a character can harvest one dose of 
spider poison, which is a Plentiful quality poison. If the 
character fails this test, they instead immediately take d6 
Poison damage as they spill or fumble the toxin sac.
• On a -10 Alchemy test over a Short Rest, a character can 
harvest the spider's eyes. They retrieve DoS eyes, up to 8 
maximum. Each eye is one Rare Mysticism ingredient.Characteristics Attributes Skills

Encountering Goblins
Goblins are savage, primitive humanoids found throughout 
Tamriel. They live in clan based societies ruled by the strongest 
of them in a hierarchy of might-makes-right. Goblins have green 
skin, yellow-slitted eyes, large fangs and elven ears, and stand 
at the height of around a man’s chin.
The most common goblins are cave goblins, which dwell in 
caves, sewers, ruins and other subterranean lairs. They typically 
build simple but deadly traps, and construct minor fortifications 
in their underground bases.
The other main type of goblins are the clan goblins, which dwell 
as nomads on the surface world, hunting and raiding as necessary. 
Clan goblins are far larger and stronger than their underground 
cousins, so naturally pose a much larger threat on the offensive 
than the relatively diminuitive cave goblins, who typically have 
the advantage on the defensive instead. Goblins are known to 
train the dog-like Durzogs for battle, and raise rats for their 
meat.
Loot
• A goblin has on its person what it is equipped with, in 
addition to about d4 drakes worth of junk weighing about 

---
## 1 ENC.
• A character can make a +0 Alchemy test to harvest a goblin 
ear, which is an Uncommon Destruction ingredient. If the 
character succeeds with more than 1 DoS, they harvest two

• Goblins are likely to have treasure stashed somewhere in 
their den. At the GM's discretion, the characters can make 
a number of rolls on the T reasure table the GM feels appro-
priate for the den.Characteristics Attributes Skills

in which their opponents resolve their defenses.

• Crawler: This creature is not slowed by difficult terrain.
• Dark SightEncountering Goblin Berserkers
Goblin berserkers are the closest equivalent to the nobles of 
goblin society. Larger, stronger, and more violent-minded than 
the lesser goblins, goblin berserkers fight with the primal rage 
of their patron, Malacath, who they worship as Muluk.
Goblin berserkers rule as second in command to a clan’s 
War-Chief, and maintain what passes as discipline in goblin 
culture. On the battlefield, goblin berserkers use their bulk and 
fury to their advantage, and press constantly on the attack, often 
forgoing defense in favor of ruthless and unending strikes. They 
often use either a broad two handed weapon they can swing 
with reckless abandon, or a pair of weapons to maximize their 
offensive output, forsaking shields in favor of heavier, more 
prestigious goblin armor worthy of their social status.
Although goblins are typically a minor threat at best against 
experienced warriors, many have been caught off-guard by a 
goblin berserker’s insane lack of self preservation: their rank in 
goblin society depends on their might and fearlessness, and to 
lose face would be worse than death.
Goblin berserkers typically do not parry incoming blows, but 
are surprisingly deft and capable of dodging should they need 
to. If it is clear that the goblins are routing in a fight, goblin 
berserkers will refuse to retreat and will fight until either they 
or their opponents are dead.

Goblin war-chiefs are the biggest, strongest, smartest goblins 
in a clan, and as such rule over their weaker kin through force 
of muscle, and through low cunning. A goblin war-chief is man 
sized or larger, and those of the nomad clans are even rumored 
to be supernaturally protected. Some scholars speculate this to 
be some sort of blessing from Malacath made manifest, though 
it warrants further study.
Goblin war-chiefs, as the highest ranking members of a clan, 
have best pick of the weapons, armor, food, durzogs, and mates, 
and they greedily hoard all of these. In a goblin clan, the war-chief 
is king, and their word is law. As a result, goblins fear, respect, 
and envy their chiefs, which results in both total loyalty and 
murderous betrayal. A goblin war-chief must be careful to keep 
their berserkers and officers in line, lest they attempt to usurp 
them.
Goblin war-chiefs, unlike goblin berserkers, will retreat if it is 
warranted, or if they can fall back to a strategic position or 
ambush. At worst, a goblin war-chief commands enough respect 
to rally their clan to make a counter-attack at a later date, but 
to not retaliate at all would certainly result in being cast down; 
as a result, any attack on a goblin clan is viewed as a personal 
insult to the war-chief.
GMs running campaigns that feature goblins as primary 
antagonists shouldn’t be afraid to deviate from the stats presented 
here to give a war-chief Talents from the Character creation 
chapter in the 3e Core Rules, or to give them magic weapons 
and armor to help differentiate war-chiefs of different clans, or 
successors to previously killed war-chiefs. Even one Combat or 
Weapon talent can help give a goblin war-chief a lot of mechanical 
personality.

Encountering Goblin Shamans
Goblin shamans serve as the high priests and religious leaders 
of the goblin clans, who worship Muluk, the goblins’ version 
of Malacath. They practice primitive elemental hedge-magic 
and concoct simple brews and poisons for their clans.
The most interesting feature of the goblin shaman is their T otem 
Staff, a brutal, bladed staff enchanted with primal magics that 
allow the casting of a single damaging cantrip at will. Goblin 
totem staves are passed down generation to generation, and 
date back to time unknown. The Totem Staff of a clan has 
profound spiritual importance to the tribe, and they will 
relentlessly hunt for their Totem Staff if stolen, either by a rival 
clan or by adventurers. Goblin scouts will range for miles and 
burn villages to the ground in night raids, and sack other goblin 
dens in their search.
Loot
• A goblin shaman has on its person what it is equipped with, 
in addition to about d12 drakes worth of fetishes and 
baubles weighing about 1 ENC. Goblin Totem Staves are 
able to always cast their innate spell. A goblin clan will stop 
at nothing to retrieve a stolen Totem Staff, and their gener-
ations breed quickly. Taking the T otem Staff will likely result 
in increased goblin raids in the coming weeks and months 
as they search for their ancestral totem.
• A character can make a +0 Alchemy test to harvest a goblin 
ear, which is an Uncommon Destruction ingredient. If the 
character succeeds with more than 1 DoS, they harvest two 
ears instead.
• Goblins are likely to have treasure stashed somewhere in 
their den. At the GM's discretion, the characters can make 
a number of rolls on the T reasure table the GM feels appro-
priate for the den.Characteristics Attributes Skills

35Harpy
Fierce, carnivorous, feminine humanoids with the colourful wings 
of a bird.
Minor; White Soul (150)
Weapons and Armor
• Talons: 1d4; Slashing, Exploit Weakness; Reach 1m
Special Abilities
• Earth’s Harsh Embrace (1 SP): Instead of dealing damage 
on a successful hit in melee with its Talons against a Medium 
or smaller target, the Harpy can spend a Stamina Point to 
grab them and soar upwards 6m without spending move-
ment. The Harpy can then immediately spend another 
Stamina Point and Action point to continue flying upwards. 
If multiple Harpies are carrying the same target, only one 
needs to spend a Stamina Point per 6m of height. This is 
treated as a Grapple for the purposes of breaking free, and 
the Harpy can choose to drop the target at any point, which 
will suffer falling damage as normal.
T raits
• Bestial
• Flyer (13m)
• Resistance (Normal Weapons, 2)Encountering Harpies
Harpies are found in places with rocky cliffs and crags suitable 
for their nests, where they live in small matriarchal groups that 
have in rare cases been known to communicate with mortals. 
They are a common nuisance around the Iliac Bay.
They are usually encountered when they leave their nests in 
order to kidnap, mate with and kill human males, or to keep 
strangers away from their nests. When threatened, harpies use 
their flight to their advantage, making hit and run attacks and 
using their powerful legs to heave characters into the air, either 
to drop them to break their bones, or to separate the party so 
they can focus their savage attacks on one target at a time. They 
prefer to fight in the open, where they can take advantage of 
their flight to its best, and high places are preferred ambush 
sites.
Harpy feathers are treasured for their vibrance, ranging from 
deep blues and greens to bright electric pinks and yellows. Their 
feathers are said to be imbued with magical properties that are 
the envy of crafters and trophy seekers.
Loot
• On a +30 Survival test over a Short Rest, a character can 
strip the harpy's feather hides, which are worth 150 drakes. 
Failing this test spoils the feathers, halving their worth.
• On a +10 Survival test over a Long Rest, a character can use 
5 harpy feather hides to create a Harpy Feather Cloak. A 
Harpy Feather cloak can be worn on the back, and weighs 
1 ENC when carried. Any time the wearer succeeds on a 
Defense Test roll, regardless of whether or not they win the 
Opposed Combat Roll, the wearer gains the Resist Normal 
Weapons 2 trait for the duration of the attack. Failing this 
test spoils the feathered hides, halving their worth and ren-
dering them useless.
• On a +0 Alchemy test, a character can harvest harpy talons 
over a Short Rest. The character harvests DoS doses of harpy 
talons, which are an Uncommon Restoration ingredient.Characteristics Attributes Skills

Found along the northern coasts of Skyrim and on the isle of 
Solstheim, horkers are large, rotund sea mammals. They have 
a trio of long tusks, valuable as ornamentation, as drinking 
horns, or as simple weapons. Horkers are coated in a thick 
insulating blubber to keep them warm in the frigid climes they 
dwell in. Horkers typically prey on sea fish and clams, but it 
isn’t unheard of for a horker to take on mudcrabs and slaugh-
terfish when desperate. 
Horkers can be found on beaches, ice shelfs, or in the cold north 
seas, and are typically docile unless approached, in which case 
they become violently defensive, though they do not often give 
chase.
Loot
• On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the horker's 
hide, worth 20 drakes, over the course of a Short Rest. Failing 
this test spoils the hide and halves its worth.
• On a +20 Survival test, a character can, over the course of 
a Long Rest, turn a horker hide into one piece of Full Horker 
Hide armor. Alternatively, creating a Full Horker Hide chest 
piece requires two horker hides. Horker Hide armour is 
exactly the same as regular Hide but provides 5 Frost Resis-
tance. Failing this test spoils the hide, halving its worth and 
rendering it useless.
• On a +30 Simple Survival test, a character can harvest meat 
from a horker over a Long Rest. The character harvest DoS*2 
days' rations of meat, which will spoil if not preserved.
• On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the horker's 
three tusks, worth 50 drakes each. These can also be fash-
ioned into daggers or spearheads, which are Bone weapons 
without the Primitive trait.
• On a +0 Alchemy test, a character can harvest the horker's 
blubber over a Short Rest, which is a Common Restoration 
ingredient. The character retrieves DoS doses.
• On a -20 Survival test, a character can fashion a water 
breathing apparatus from a horker's air bladder over a Short 
Rest. Using the breathing bladder allows a character to hold 
their breath twice as long underwater.Characteristics Attributes Skills

Encountering Horses
Horses are large, quadrupedal beasts that can be found both in 
the wild and raised and bred in captivity by the various cultures 
on Tamriel. Wild horses spook easily, and are very fast. Fighting 
wild horses is a rare occurence due to their preference to flee, 
but an angry horse is no laughing matter.
In combat, a horse will trample its foes with its large, powerful 
hooves, or by charging and headbutting its foes before stomping 
on them when they are underfoot. A horse that is wrangled will 
buck and kick violently, and its not unheard of for errant 
stablehands to be brutally killed by their charges.
For this reason, particularly angry or poorly tempered destriers 
are the preferred war horses of the peoples of Tamriel, though 
the horses themselves are as varied as man and mer alike. For 
example, the sleek horses of Hammerfell as thin and fast, their 
wide hooves ideal for travel on sand, and the hardy horses of 
Skyrim are large, shaggy coated, and muscular.Loot
• On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the horse's

Encountering Imps
Imps can be found across Tamriel, but are most common in the 
Cyrodilic highlands. Their preferred dwellings are caves, ruins, 
abandoned villages, or the trees themselves, the small creatures 
are not particularly picky.
Imps are of low to average intelligence, and can be found living 
in small communities, but to call them any sort of society would 
be a stretch. Imps band together to bring down larger prey, 
which they eat and plunder, but the moment their mutual goals 
are met, the imps will turn on one another, convinced the 
treasure and meat is theirs and theirs alone. For this reason, 
imps are most commonly found solitary, or in the presence of 
other dead imps.
Despite their violent nature, they have been known to have 
been tamed and befriended by men and mer. They have been 
recorded to occasionally carry precious items like enchanted 
rings and even small effigies of their own kind. Whether or not 
the imps in question understand the true nature of the magic 
items they carry, or how and why they would have such dolls 
is entirely unknown.
Imps attack nearly exclusively using primitive hedge-magicks, 
and they are happy to attack any travelers or creatures they find, 
often going up against monsters and heroes many times their 
size without fear. Imps never flee from combat, and are suicidally 
brave.
Where all these imps are coming from, considering they tend 
to violently kill one another, and often die to large monsters or 
adventurers in suicidal attacks, nobody knows. It is a complete 
and total mystery, and has been for centuries.

Lamia are amphibious beast-peoples. The species is exclusively 
female, or at least appears outwardly so. They have a serpentine 
lower body, with a humanoid torso resembling a human female, 
though their appearance can range from fully human to fully 
snake- like.
Lamia can be found all over Tamriel, and though they can live 
on land, are seldom found far from water. Although they are 
hated as being a violent beast-race, Lamia are comparably 
intelligent to the humanoids of the Empire, and speak Tam-
rielic.
Lamia adorn themselves with jewelry in the pursuit of vanity, 
and covet treasure. When not in their lairs, tending to their 
cherished eggs, they hunt for aquatic game or raid ships and 
coastal caravans for the gold and jewels they carry.
In combat, Lamia make use of powerful Destruction magic, 
and though they prefer to use magic and have powerful claws, 
are more than capable of using weapons and armor as well. If 
they become threatened as enemies close in, they will use their 
T errifying Shriek in an attempt to deter them. Lamia will defend 
their eggs with their lives, but if a battle is plainly lost, they will 
attempt to gather as many eggs as they can carry before retreating 
away to deep water.
Loot
• On a +0 Survival test, a character can remove the Lamia's 
hide, worth 300 drakes, over the course of a Long Rest. 
Failing this test spoils the hide and halves its worth.
• On a +10 Survival test, a character can, over the course of 
a Long Rest, turn a snake hide into one piece of Full Lamia 
Hide armour. Alternatively, creating a Full Lamia Hide chest 
piece requires two snake hides. Lamia Hide armour is exactly 
the same as regular Hide, but is strikingly vibrant, and has 
Magic Resistance 1.
• On a +0 Alchemy test over a Short Rest, a character can 
harvest the Lamia's forked tongue, which is a Very Rare 
Illusion ingredient.
• A character can roll on the T reasure Table, to represent the 
Lamia's worn jewelry.Characteristics Attributes Skills

41Lion
Mountain lions are agile, dangerous predators. They inhabit the 
wooded and rocky areas in the temperate climes of Tamriel, like 
Cyrodiil and High Rock.
Beast; Average; White (180)
Weapons and Armor
• Bite: 1d8; Splitting; Reach 1m
• Claws: 1d10; Slashing; Reach 1m
Special Abilities
• Rake (1 SP): The Lion can rake a target savagely and roll a 
second attack against a target that was successfully damaged. 
This attack cannot win advantages.
T raits
• Bestial
• Strong Jaws: A Bite attack made by this character that deals 
damage automatically starts a Grapple. The test to contest 
this Grapple is made against the original test made by the 
attacker. If the target Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the 
Counter Attack ignores the creature’s AR and Natural 
Toughness trait.
• Catfall: Reduces the distance the Lion falls by 4 meters 
when calculating fall damage.
• Dark Sight
• Diseased (+0): If the creature successfully deals damage to 
an undiseased target with their natural weapons, the target 
creature must succeed on a +0 Endurance test or contract a 
Common Disease.
• Quadruped
• Stealth Predator:  The lion adds 3 bonus damage to success-
ful attacks made while hidden.Encountering Lions
Lions, and other big cats such as mountain lions, tigers, cougars, 
and the like, can be found either in prides or as solitary hunters, 
depending on the species. A lion’s pride is composed of a group 
of females and one male. The females will work together to 
hunt, first using stealth, then using explosive power and incredible 
speed to close the gap. The lions are coordinated and dangerous, 
and will cut off routes of escape.
A lone lion will instead use stealth and cunning to separate a 
single target out from their herd or group, and violently run 
them to the ground, hoping their companions leave them be-
hind.
Lions tend to be slothful when not hunting, and typically 
maintain a handful of small dens over their ranging lands. They 
could be considered semi- migratory, depending on the season 
and the patterns of their prey. Lions will typically retreat from 
a poor fight, and are clever enough to not start a fight they can’t 
win.
Loot
• On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the lion's 
hide, worth 40 drakes, over the course of a Long Rest. Failing 
this test spoils the hide and halves its worth.
• On a +20 Survival test, a character can, over the course of 
a Long Rest, turn a lion hide into one piece of Full Lion 
Hide armour. Alternatively, creating a Full Lion Hide chest 
piece requires two lion hides. Lion Hide armour is exactly 
the same as regular Hide, but each piece gives the wearer a 
cumulative +5 bonus to resisting Fear. Failing the Survival 
test spoils the hide, halving its worth and rendering it useless.
• On a +30 Simple Survival test, a character can harvest meat 
from a lion over a Long Rest. The character harvest DoS*2 
days' rations of meat, which will spoil if not preserved.
• On a +0 Alchemy test over a Short Rest, a character can 
remove and prepare the lion's eyes, which are each one Rare 
Destruction ingredient.Characteristics Attributes Skills

Encountering Minotaurs
Minotaurs are a beast race, composed of half-men half-bulls, 
found in Cyrodiil. Their great and profound role in the found-
ing of the First Empire has long been forgotten, in no small 
part due to the meddling of the old Alessian Order, and as of 
the Third Era, are regarded as little more than savage creatures, 
comparable to ogres and goblins. Minotaurs are social, and 
often are found in war herds of twenty or more. They congregate 
around old ruins, of historical significance to the First Empire, 
though it is unknown if this is deliberate or because of some 
long forgotten Instinct.
While they have little interaction with the Empire, there is no 
bounty on their heads as there is on goblins or ogres, as they 
are content to live in peace in the wilds around the ruins they 
inhabit. In combat, they are hyper-aggressive and absolutely 
punishing in their blows. If significantly threatened, minotaurs 
will retreat deeper into their labyrinthine ruins, and wait for 
the threat to pass, or to foolishly pursue them into their den.
Loot
• On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the minotaur's 
hide, worth 100 drakes, over the course of a Long Rest. 
Failing this test spoils the hide and halves its worth.
• On a +20 Survival test, a character can, over the course of 
a Long Rest, turn a minotaur hide into one piece of Full 
Minotaur Hide armor. Alternatively, creating a Full Minotaur 
Hide chest piece requires two minotaur hides. minotaur 
Hide armor is exactly the same as regular Hide.
• On a +30 Simple Survival test, a character can harvest meat 
from a Minotaur over a Long Rest. The character harvest 
DoS*2 days' rations of meat, which will spoil if not preserved.
• On a +0 Alchemy test, a character can harvest the minotaur's 
horns over a Short Rest. Each horn is a Very Rare Restoration 
ingredient. If the character scores more than 1 DoS, they 
harvest two horns instead of one.Characteristics Attributes Skills

44Mudcrab
Mudcrabs are small hostile creatures primarily found near water. 
They are capable of disguising themselves as small rocks to ambush 
their prey.
Beast; T rivial; White Soul (20)
Weapons and Armor
• Claws: 1d4; Reach 1m
• Mudcrab Chitin: 1 AR; Full
Special Abilities
• Grab On (1 SP): If the creature successfully hits a target 
with its claws it grabs on with all its strength, initiating a 
grapple. As a result, the grappled character receives a -20 
penalty to their attempts to break free. Alternatively, the 
grappled target can instead end the grapple as a free action. 
In doing so, they suffer the Bleeding (2) Condition and 
must test for Disease.
T raits
• Amphibious: Can Can breathe water and ignores the skill 
cap placed water and ignores the skill cap placed on their 
Combat rolls by their Athletics when fighting in water.
• Bestial
• Diseased (-10):  If the creature successfully deals damage 
to an undiseased target with their natural weapons, the target 
creature must succeed on a -10 Endurance test or contract 
a Common Disease.
• Swimmer: This creature doubles its movement speed in 
water.
Variant: Cyrodilic Mudcrab
Traits
• Crab Leap (1 SP): The crab leaps up to 3m, and makes a 
claw attack against the target. Dodging or Parrying the attack 
has a -20 penalty as the crab catches them off-guard. If the 
attack successfully hits the target, the crab additionally 
automatically Grabs On, as described in that ability.
• QuadrupedEncountering Mudcrabs
Mudcrabs are a ubiquitous coastal and river pest found all across 
the breadth of the Empire and beyond. From Morrowind, to 
Skyrim, to the heartlands of Cyrodiil, all the way to the golden 
yellow coasts of Summerset, mudcrabs can be found. Mudcrabs 
often lurk in the shallow waters, or on the waterfronts of virtually 
any body of salt or fresh water, sifting the sand with their filter 
mouths for food.
Mudcrabs are often docile, or at least non- confrontational, but 
many otherwise unaware travelers or fishers find themselves 
literally tripping and stumbling on mudcrabs they thought were 
just rocks or driftwood, to which the mudcrabs do not take too 
kindly. Mudcrabs will cry out to rally other mudcrabs in the 
area to repel aggressors from their feeding grounds if they feel 
threatened, and will pursue targets an unreasonable distance 
while giving chase.
Loot
• On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the mudcrab's 
shell, worth 15 drakes, over the course of a Short Rest. Failing 
this test spoils the chitin and halves its worth.
• On a +20 Survival test, a character can, over the course of 
a Long Rest, turn a mudcrab shell into one piece of Full 
Mudcrab Chitin armor. Alternatively, creating a Full Mudcrab 
Chitin chest piece requires two mudcrab hides. Mudcrab 
Chitin armor is exactly the same as regular Chitin, but 
provides 1 Frost Resistance instead of 1 Fire Resistance.
• On a +30 Simple Survival test, a character can harvest meat 
from a mudcrab over a Short Rest. The character harvest 
DoS/2 days' rations of meat, which will spoil if not preserved. 
After eating mudcrab meat, a character must test Endurance 
+20 or contract Common Disease.
• On a +0 Alchemy test over a Short Rest, a character can 
attempt to harvest the Mudcrab's claw, which is a Common 
Restoration ingredient. If they score greater than one DoS, 
they harvest two claws instead.Characteristics Attributes Skills

Encountering Ogres
An adventurer is most likely to come across an ogre while 
exploring the backwoods and natural caverns of Cyrodiil, though 
they can be found across all of Tamriel, particularly in the Drag-
ontail and Wrothgarian Mountains. If food is to be found, one 
can be sure that ogres are not far behind. 
While many would think ogres are stupid or dim witted, ogres 
have proven in the past to possess reasonable intelligence, at 
least in the case of their leadership. For example, the Ironhand 
ogres proved a significant threat to the region of Stormhaven, 
and the ogres of Wrothgar helped found the first Orsinium 
alongside the orcs and goblins.
Ogre dwellings are home to small, primitive hunter-gatherer 
communities. Their culture is also primitive, and their dwellings 
are home to rotting carcasses, stripped bones, and the occasional 
shrine to Malacath, their patron. Ogres raiding settlements is 
far from unheard of, and often a legitimate concern for those 
in the frontier regions in Cyrodiil, though these raids most often 
end in stolen livestock rather than sacked villages. In combat, 
ogres use large clubs, rocks, and their crushing fists as weapons. 
Ogres are notoriously heavy sleepers, and are astutely imperceptive. 
However, this very lack of perception girds them from illusion 
magic.
Loot
• An ogre has on its person what it is equipped with, in addition 
to about 2d10 drakes worth of trophies weighing 1 ENC.
• A character can make a +0 Alchemy test to harvest and grind 
up one dose of ogre teeth, which is a Very Rare Alteration 
ingredient. If the character scores more than 1 DoS on the 
test, they harvest 2 doses instead.
• Ogres are likely to have treasure stashed somewhere in their 
den. At the GM's discretion, the characters can make a 
number of rolls on the T reasure table the GM feels appropriate 
for the den.Characteristics Attributes Skills

Slaughterfish are small, hostile fish with razor sharp teeth.

Special Abilities
• Gang Up (1 SP): Can gang up by spending a Stamina Point 
when an enemy in Reach is attacked by another allied 
Slaughterfish. Ganging up imposes a -10 on the target's 
Defense roll. Additionally, each ganging up Slaughterfish 
adds +1 damage to the attacking Slaughterfish's damage.

to spend its actions flopping around helplessly.
• Swimmer: Doubles movement speed in water.
• Teamwork: Gains a bonus DoS on any attack rolls made 
while an ally with Teamwork is in Reach of the same target.Encountering Slaughterfish
Slaughterfish are hostile, predatory fish that can dwell in both 
fresh and salt water. This adaptability, and aggressive and ex-
ploratory demeanor, has lead to their infestation of virtually all 
the waterways and seas of Tamriel, establishing themselves as 
an apex predator in spite of their small size.
Slaughterfish can be found in nearly every body of water capable 
of sustaining a suitable population of prey for them to feed on, 
and they are proliferous reproducers, spawning in massive schools 
of hundreds of baby fish at a time. Most of the babies are eaten 
by their parents, who have no love for their offspring.
Slaughterfish do not retreat from a fight, and are extremely 
territorial. They live in small hunting schools, though it is not 
unheard of for them to swarm up into massive schools that go 
on feeding frenzies, draining entire lakes and rivers of life before 
starving off themselves, restarting the natural cycle and allowing 
water life to return to the area, before a new brood of slaughterfish 
inevitably find their way to the ecosystem.
Loot
• On a +30 Simple Survival test, a character can harvest meat 
from a Slaughterfish over a Short Rest. The character harvest 
DoS/2 days' rations of meat, which will spoil if not preserved.

• Weakness (Fire, 5)Encountering Cave T rolls
T rolls are massive, ape-like apex predators with three eyes and 
regenerative properties. They can be found all across Tamriel, 
but are more common in the colder and temperate climates. 
They make permanent dens in caves or under large rocky 
outcroppings, typically deep in the wilderness, but it is not 
uncommon that a troll establishes its lair near civilization to 
make preying upon it easier.
Although unintelligent and animalistic, some trolls are capable 
of learning basic Tamrielic and literacy. They occasionally band 
into simple tribes to raid towns, but these tribes quickly fall 
apart.
It is common knowledge that trolls are vulnerable to fire and 
flames, which prevents their flesh from knitting itself back to-
gether, at least for a time.
Loot
• On a -10 Survival test, a character can remove the frost troll's 
hide, worth 150 drakes, over the course of a Short Rest. 
These hides are 2 ENC. Failing this test spoils the pelt, 
halving its worth.
• On a +10 Survival test, a character can, over the course of 
a Long Rest, turn a troll hide into two pieces of Full T roll 
Hide armour, or one Full T roll Hide chest piece. T roll Hide 
armour is exactly the same as regular Hide but has +2 AR, 
and Weakness (Fire, 1). Failing this test spoils the pelt instead, 
rendering it useless and halving its worth.
• On a +0 Alchemy test, a character can scrape the troll's bones 
for one dose of troll fat, which is an Extremely Rare Restora-
tion and Destruction ingredient.
• On a +20 Survival test, a character can fashion a T roll Skull

Frost T rolls are much like standard Cave T rolls, except they have

resistance to the cold and general survivability.

Wolves are aggressive canines found throughout T amriel. They are 
packs hunters and can often be found in packs of two or three, using 
their highly developed sense of smell to track their prey. When threat-

When attacking, they will often attempt to circle around behind

Wolves can be found across Tamriel, but are more common in 
the colder or temperate climes. They are pack hunters, traveling 
in family groups of around a dozen. They work together using 
concentrated efforts to bring down prey much larger than 
themselves.
Surprisingly cunning, wolves are lead by a pack alpha, who can 
coordinate complex hunting plans among their followers. Many 
an unfortunate adventurer has found themselves outflanked 
and outwitted by the devilish creatures.
Notorious for hunting livestock, wolves often have a price on 
their heads by local authorities, not to mention the hazard they 
pose to isolated villages and unsupervised children.
Wolves in combat will focus on the weakest members of a group, 
and drag them to the ground, while using their teeth to cripple 
and thrash prey into submission. Wolves are capable of coordi-
nated attacks and devious plans, and in large numbers can be 
a formidable foe for even experienced adventurers.
Loot
• On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the wolf 's 
pelt, worth 25 drakes, over the course of a Short Rest. Ice 
Wolf pelts are worth 50 drakes. If the character fails this 
test, the pelt is spoiled, halving its worth.
• On a +20 Survival test, a character can, over the course of 
a Long Rest, turn a wolf pelt into one piece of Full Wolf 
Fur armor. Wolf Fur armor is exactly the same as regular 
Fur. Ice Wolf Fur armor grants an additional +2 Frost 
Resistance. Failing the crafting test spoils the pelt, halving 
its worth and rendering it useless.
• On a +20 Simple Survival test over a Short Rest, a character 
can harvest DoS days' rations of wolf meat, which will spoil 
within a day if not properly preserved.
• On a +0 Alchemy test, a character can harvest the wolf 's 
heart over a Short Rest. A wolf 's heart is an Uncommon 
Alteration ingredient.Characteristics Attributes Skills
