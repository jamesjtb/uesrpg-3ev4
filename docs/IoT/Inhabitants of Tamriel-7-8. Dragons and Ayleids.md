you as Dragonborn.
Cost: 300 XP + Burn 10 Luck
Requirements: Can only be taken at character creation with
express GM permission
Benefits:

of Kings.

Voice elite advance at the cost for a Nord.

Note:  This character option was adapted from TutorialTuna’s
“Additional Player Options” homebrew document. You can find
a link to his homebrew repository in the Additional Resources sec-
tion of the appendix.Rite of Undeath: Skeletal
Dragon
This ritual follows the standard rules for the Rite of Undeath
defined in Chapter 6 of the Rules Compendium. The specific
rules for raising a Skeletal Dragon are as follows:
Skeletal Dragons require 2000 Magicka to raise and require 5
hours of ritual time. A Skeletal Dragon requires the complete
corpse of a dovah, the bones of which must be laid out in a
space large enough to contain the bones laid out and ready for
magical assembly. The process of laying the bones out in this
way takes 3 hours, during which the bones must be treated with
2000 drakes worth of oils and ointments.
Once the proper preparations have been made, invoking the
incantations and ritualistic motions to successfully raise the
skeletal dragon requires passing a -30 Necromancy test in place
of the standard difficulty test for this ritual. On a failure, repeating
the ritual requires all costs to be re-spent, including retreating
the bones with the materials, and the bones must be meticu-
lously examined for the 3 hours that the character would have
used to arrange the bones in the first attempt at the ritual.

178Encountering Dovah
The Dovah, commonly known as Dragons, are legendary beasts
of Aedric origin. They are living calamities, capable of destroying
entire armies and burning cities by themselves.
Dovah consider themselves to be the progeny of Bormahu,
known as Akatosh or Auri-El to mortals, and thus view the
domination of Mundus as their birthright. In ages long since
forgotten they ruled the world under the leadership of the black
dragon Alduin, the Firstborn of Akatosh. Their reign only ended
thanks to the intervention of the Divines on behalf of
mortalkind.
Dovah are the deadliest creatures within this book and GMs
should use them sparingly, if at all. Only the strongest, most
experienced, and best-equipped parties even have a chance of
defeating one in battle, and even then the likelihood of the
party's death is high.
Caution should be taken by any GM who wishes to use these
veritable demigods. If they are used, they should almost certainly
serve as a final and greatest foe for legendary heroes to faceLoot

• A character, over a long rest, can use 1 Dragon Scale to create
a piece of Dragon Scale Armor or a Dragon Scale Shield, 2

• A character can make a -20 Alchemy test to harvest a dose
of “Dragon’s Blood”, which is valued at 1000 Drakes, and
is a Legendary Restoration, Alteration, & Destruction in-
gredient.

10 rolls on the treasure table, multiply any drakes by 100.

• (Racial) Empowered by Starlight:  Ayleid characters in-
crease their Willpower bonus for the purpose of spell restraint
by 2 while under direct starlight. The Ayleid can choose to
forfeit this bonus for the rest of the night in order to absorb
some of the power radiating down on it, regaining 15 Mag-
icka instantly.
• (Racial) Flesh Shaping: When an Ayleid uses any Restoration
spell that regenerates a target’s health, it can choose to instead
inflict the specified amount as Magic damage. Additionally,
an Ayleid can use the Stabilize spell to T reat Wounds.
"The ancient Ayleids believed that Nirn was composed of
four basic elements -- earth, water, air, and light -- and of
these four elements, they believed the most sublime form of
light was star light. The stars are our links to the plane of
Aetherius, the source of all magical power, and therefore,
light from the stars is the most potent and exalted of all mag-
ical powers."
