Daedric incursion, expect to find these creatures among the
enemy. If in trouble fighting Flame Atronachs, remember to
avoid using offensive fire spells and equip yourself to defend
against them in turn, and keep your distance lest you end up
burning alive with it as it explodes upon death.

creatures thrive in melee as they sap warriors dry of their stamina
and crush them beneath their massive limbs.

along with its affinity for its namesake element. Appearing as a

kind of humanoid, these Atronachs will fling deadly Shock
spells at their foes, and at times will bash at foes with their own
rocky forms if someone survives long enough to engage them
in melee.

compounds called shock salts may be salvaged from the re-
mains of banished storm atronachs."

123Encountering Aureals
These golden clad warriors of the mad prince can be found most
often within the Shivering isles, where they can be seen watching
over the inhabitants of Mania. A matriarchal humanoid species
of daedra, it is rare to even come across a male Aureal as within
their society they are looked down upon when compared to
their female counterparts. Being only one half of Sheogorath’s
army, these “saints” hold a large amount of distaste for the mortal
races. For the most part this race is proud, arrogant, quick to
anger, and they deal out very cruel punishments.
In combat most Golden Saints are very aggressive and not afraid
to fight with the golden weapons they wield, but most of them
also are proficient spellcasters and are not predisposed to burning,
freezing, and shocking their adversaries.Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a Golden
Saint’s weapons and armor will be recoverable, otherwise
the Saint’s body and equipment vanish back to Oblivion.
Golden Saints’ arms and armor have the same weight and
enchant values as Malachite.
• Additionally, if slain while permanently bound to Mundus,
a character can make a -40 Alchemy test to salvage the
Daedra’s Heart, which is a Legendary Restoration ingredient.

Additionally, they ignore the Unwieldy trait when parrying.
• Resistance (Normal Weapons, Shock, 5)
• Resistance (Magic, 2)
• Weakness (Shadow, 5)Encountering Aurorans
Be it heeding the call of the Ayleids or their master and creator
Meridia, Aurorans will typically be found in Ayleid ruins, for
whatever regal or divine purpose they may have been given.
Their preference for heavy armor and shock enchanted weapons
is universal, and as such any preparations dedicated to dealing
with them can always take those factors into account. The
Aurorans are well known for their universal and nearly inescapable
true hatred of the undead, worshipers of the undead, and any
that may raise or produce undead.
Aurorans were essential in the defeat of Molag Bol during the
Planemeld during the Interregnum of the Second Era, and are
as exalted for their deep and dear hatred of the undead as their
mistress and creator, the former Magna-Ge, Merid-Nunda, or,
the Daedric Prince of Light, Meridia.
They typically wield axes and look to be made of sunlight and
bone, and lack any sort of perceptible facial features, known
only for their helmeted heads, and lack of skin. They are ruthless
and will slay any and all who may tread their masters’ dwellings.
Loot

Be it heeding the call of the Ayleids or their master and creator
Meridia, Aurorans will typically be found in Ayleid ruins, for
whatever regal or divine purpose they may have been given.
Their preference for heavy armor and shock enchanted weapons
is universal, and as such any preparations dedicated to dealing
with them can always take those factors into account.
They typically wield axes and look to be made of sunlight and
bone, and lack any sort of perceivable facial features, known
only for their helmeted heads, and lack of skin. They’re very
ubiquitous looking, and genuinely seem to lack souls. They are
ruthless and will slay any and all who may tread their masters’
dwellings. Lesser Aurorans will typically be seen in the depths
of Ayleid ruins, in the employ of a priest of Meridia or an Ayleid
lord. They are one of few groups of Aurorans who will work
with undead, as Meridia’s influence is not very strong on them.
Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, an Auroran’s
weapons and armor will be recoverable, otherwise the

Encountering Guardians
Aurorans typically wield axes and look to be made of sunlight
and bone, and lack any sort of perceivable facial features, known
only for their helmeted heads, and lack of skin. They are ruthlessly
slay any who tread their masters’ dwellings. Colored Guardians
are an elite class of Auroran, whose duty is to guard their Creator,
Meridia, and follow important orders with which they will give
their lives. Colored Guardians will usually only be seen inside
of Oblivion, but when called to Tamriel, they can serve as bosses
on their own, not to mention potentially being under the control
of powerful Sorcerer-Kings. They can be found in large, towering
Ayleid citadels with a vast number of Lesser Aurorans.
Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, an Auroran’s
weapons and armor will be recoverable, otherwise the
Auroran’s body and equipment vanish back to Oblivion.

127Banekin
A small Daedra resembling a winged humanoid. Banekin are
associated with Molag Bal and use powerful shock spells in combat.
They can speak T amrielic, and are sometimes used as familiars by
powerful wizards.

Weapons and Armor
• Shocking Claws:  1d4 + 2 Shock; Slashing, Exploit Weak-
ness, Small, Magic; Reach 1m.
• Natural T oughness (2)
Special Abilities
• Static Envelopment (1 AP + 1 SP):  As a Secondary Action,
the Banekin can conjure a crackling aura of electricity, deal-
ing 1d4 shock damage to any character within 2m at the
start of their turn. At the start of each of the Banekin's turns,

• Shock Bite 3:  7 MP; 1d8 Shock; Attack, Overload (+WpB
to Damage), Melee (1m)Encountering Banekin
The Banekin mainly serve Molag Bal, and aren’t seen too much
outside of their sphere of Influence in Oblivion, but within
Tamriel there are many conjurers that summon this tiny devil
to harass their opponents with shock damage. They can also be
used to do minor menial tasks which is why they’re popular as
familiars to more powerful wizards.
Primarily a melee focused caster, the Banekin use Shock Bite
spells in conjunction with its unique lightning ball to cause
havoc in battle. Being one of the smallest Daedra, they’re often
overlooked, much to their targets misfortune though. A single
Banekin may not seem like much, but when more are summoned
they quickly become a very dangerous threat to those around
them, through sheer weight of numbers and the volume of static
electricity discharging violently through the air.
Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a Banekin’s
Claws, which are a Rare Illusion ingredient, can be harvested
with a -10 Alchemy test. Otherwise, the Banekin’s body
vanishes back to Oblivion.

Clannfear are dinosaur-like Daedra that resemble a lizard with a
large, bony crest on their head and a sharp beak and talons. They
walk on two legs and use their clawed arms much like a predatory
dinosaur would. They are generally thought to be of animal intel-
ligence, though it is possible that they are intelligent enough to be
communicated with at times.

AR and Natural Toughness trait.
• Weakness (Shock, 3)Encountering Clannfears
Clannfear are typically found in the Deadlands, and are mostly
associated with the Daedric Prince Mehrunes Dagon. These
monsters are among the more common variety of summoned
monsters by conjurers, as they aren’t too hard to handle. At the
beginning of any fight this Daedra charges through its enemies,
knocking them down and crushing through their armor. It also
boasts a unique ability to reflect damage, another quality that
makes it suitable to be used on the front lines of battle.
Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a character
can test Alchemy at -10 to harvest the Clannfear’s Claws,
which are a Rare Destruction ingredient, otherwise the
Clannfear vanished back to the realms of Oblivion.
• Additionally, if slain while permanently bound to Mundus,
a character can test Survival at -20 over the course of a Long
Rest to flay the Clannfear’s hide, worth 100 drakes. On a
-30 Survival test over another Long Rest, a character can
turn the Clannfear hide into one piece of Full Clannfear
Leather Armor or two pieces of Partial Clannfear Leather
Armor. Clannfear Leather Armor is exactly the same as
Leather Armor but has +1 AR, and additionally grants the
wearer the Daedric Reflection trait on the worn Hit Location.

"The Clannfear is a Daedric cohort of low status in the service of a Daedric Prince or Lord. They are sometimes branded to reveal
their loyalty, and they have a tough body clad in scales and a beaked head with an elongated crest. They usually take on the ap-
pearance of a lizard and vary in size and strength. Though they attack with a feral ferocity, they have not mastered even rudimen-
tary tool use. Instead they rely on gashing their foes through biting, clawing, and lashing with their tail spikes. They are dreadful
demons but by no means clever."

Toughness trait.
• Weakness (Sunlight, 5)Encountering Daedrats
Daedrats are probably the most lowly of all the daedric creatures
known. More of a pest and nuisance than an actual threat in
most cases. Not many actually know where they originated from
in Oblivion, some believe that they’re associated with Molag
Bal or Mehrunes Dagon.
In battle, Daedrats like to use pack tactics and surprise their
opponents by leaping towards them from a small distance. Other
than that, in battle they rely on their bite and claws to rip at
their enemies.
Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a character
can test Alchemy at +0 to harvest the Daedrat Tail, which
is an Uncommon Illusion ingredient.
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a character

Daedra Heart, which is a Rare Restoration ingredient.

Toughness trait.

all other characters must immediately test for Panic at -20.
• Savage: The creature rolls damage twice and keeps the highest
roll.
• Resistance (Fire, Normal Weapons, 5)
• Weakness (Shock, 3)
Encountering Daedroths
These fearsome beasts are one the most physically powerful
monstrosities that Oblivion can hold. Mostly associated with
the Daedric princes Molag Bal and Mehrunes Dagon, these
Daedra are the perfect shock troops to decimate any foe in their
way.
With crocodile sized heads and enormous bodies larger than
most mortal man and mer, a single bite from one of these could
tear someone in two with ease. Some have even been known to
wear armor and use weapons, but for the most part they prefer
to use their claws and mouth to rip their foes apart. Boasting
resistances to non-magical weapons and fire, this Daedra is also
not easy to kill, and even possesses a fire breath that roasts their
enemies alive. Do not take this Daedra lightly, as it will not
hesitate to destroy any party of adventurers with ease.
Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a character
can test Alchemy at -20 to harvest the Daedroth’s Teeth,
which are a Very Rare Alteration ingredient.

Encountering Dremora Churls
Dremora can be seen all across Oblivion, in service to most of
the Daedric princes, but the most common Princes you’ll see
them employed by are Molag Bal, Mehrunes Dagon, and
Boethia. These fearsome warriors have a class based clan system,
the more important to watch out for are the Kynreeve, Kyn-
marcher, Markynaz, and Valkynaz. These are more powerful
Dremora that are leaders of the lesser Dremora of their clan.
Being very powerful warriors as well as mages, the Dremora are
very formidable in battle and will not hesitate to utterly obliterate
their enemies with a fireball in one hand a legendary sword in
the other. Armed with some of the best crafted gear as well, It
would be unwise to take on these Daedra head on in a fight.
Along with other Daedra the Dremora share a mutual hatred
of the mortal race. Despite this Dremora are actually one of the
few most commonly summoned Daedra, despite being among
the strongest Daedra. They’re employed by many powerful
spellcasters to do their bidding for however long they are sum-
moned, which can sometimes be indefinitely tied to the Spellcaster.
Dremora Churls are the lowest ranking of these Daedra, and
from the bulk of the standing armies of Oblivion’s most militant
Princes.
Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a Dremora
Churl’s weapons and armor will be recoverable, otherwise
the Dremora’s body and equipment vanish back to Oblivion.

begrudgingly or solely out of fear, it makes no difference. Where
a Kynmarcher is found, an army is to follow.
Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a Dremora
Kynmarcher’s weapons and armor will be recoverable,
otherwise the Dremora’s body and equipment vanish back
to Oblivion. Dremora arms and armor have the same en-
chant value and weight as Daedric.

a character can make a -40 Alchemy test to salvage the
Daedra’s Heart, which is a Legendary Restoration Ingredient.Characteristics Attributes Skills

136Dremora Lord
The Dremora Valkynaz, also known simply as a Dremora Lord, is
the mightiest kind of Dremora to be found. The highest and most
esteemed of the Dremora titles, the Valkynaz commands legions and
sunders men apart. It is said that their Daedric armor is created
by binding their own predecessors’ essence to the new armor, for a
Dremora Valkynaz is never promoted: they exclusively usurp.

137Encountering Dremora Lords
Dremora Lords regularly surround themselves with trusted
retainers; proven Kynmarchers and the like. It is difficult to
fight a Lord without their backup, for the Dremora are clannish
and militaristic. They are not warriors, they are soldiers, an
important distinction.
Dremora Lords wear the greatest armor and bear the greatest
weapons of the infernal legions. It is said that a Valkynaz’ first
act upon usurping their predecessor is to cut out their heart and
steal their soul, and bind it to a freshly forged piece of armor
or weapon. The arms and armor a Dremora Valkynaz bears are
a reminder of all that came before, and a warning that he was
better than them all.Like Kynmarchers, Dremora Lords are a brutally effective force
multiplier, and use their supernatural Kynmarch ability to rouse
their soldiers to further and further violence. Killing a Dremora
Lord, or their followers, as fast as possible should be the priority
of any warband facing the displeasure of fighting one of these
Daedric warlords.
Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a Dremora
Lord’s weapons and armor will be recoverable, otherwise the
Dremora’s body and equipment vanish back to Oblivion.
• Additionally, if slain while permanently bound to Mundus,
a character can make a -40 Alchemy test to salvage the
Daedra’s Heart, which is a Legendary Restoration ingredient.

138Hell Hound
The Hell Hound is a predatory, wolf-like daedra stalking the Nether
Planes of oblivion. Striking from the darkness with fang and jaw,
it can easily tear prey apart, though its most horrifying trait is the
fiery breath that strikes you from afar.
Daedra; Average; White Soul (300)
Weapons and Armor
• Infernal Bite: 1d8; Slashing, Magic; Reach 1m
• Natural T oughness (3)
Special Abilities
• Latch On (1 SP): If the creature successfully Bites a target
which results in a grapple, it latches on as a free action. As
a result, the grappled character receives a -20 penalty to their
attempts to break free. Alternatively, the grappled target can
instead end the grapple as a free action. In doing so, they
suffer the Bleeding (2) Condition and must test for Disease.
• Shadow Strike (1 SP):  After making a successful melee
attack while Hidden, the Hound deals an additional 1d6+3
damage that ignores armor.
• Fire Breath (1 AP + 1 SP): The Hell Hound can unleash a

Action, dealing 1d10 Fire Damage to all targets in this area.T raits

• Netherbeast:  The Hell Hound ignores all movement restric-
tions from the Hidden condition. If it kills a target with a
melee attack while Hidden, it can attempt a Stealth test
opposed by the Observe of anyone that could have seen the
attack. If successful, it retains the Hidden condition. Addi-
tionally, when the Hell Hound successfully rolls Stealth, it
scores a minimum of 4 Degrees of Success.
• Quadruped
• Resistance (Normal Weapons, 5)
• Strong Jaws: An Infernal Bite attack that deals damage
automatically starts a Grapple. The test to contest this Grapple
is made against the original test made by the attacker. If the
target Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the Counter Attack
ignores the creature’s AR and Natural Toughness trait.
• Unrelenting:  Characters cannot Disengage while in melee
range of a Hell Hound.
Encountering Hell Hounds
Hell Hounds are not tied to the service of any particular Daedric
Prince and, as a result, fall under Peryite’s protection. The Hell
Hounds stalk through shadows to chase their quarry. Who sends
them, or why the pursue their prey are entirely unknown.
Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a character
can test Alchemy at -40 to harvest its shadow ichor, which
is a Legendary Illusion ingredient, otherwise the Hell Hound
will vanish back to Oblivion.

Encountering Hungers
Hungers can be found throughout Oblivion, but are mostly
found in the service of Boethiah. These little monstrosities attack
with a ferocity known only to Daedra. They can be seen clawing
away armor as it disintegrates at their touch and poisoning their
enemies with their lashing tongue. It is not wise to engage one
in melee, as you may find your weapon falling to pieces in your
hand before you can even strike them.

141Encountering Dark Seducers
Mazken are the spawn of the Daedric prince of madness, and
can be found in Shivering isles guarding Dementia. These Daedra
are known for their cruelty and malice towards mortals, and
can sometimes be found with large retractable bat-like wings.
Their society, like the Golden Saints, is matriarchal and it is a
rare occurrence to see a male Mazken. Unlike the Golden Saints,
though, the Mazken are lot less loyal, and tend to be very fond
of betrayal. Many Mazken can be seen across Oblivion serving
many Daedric Princes.
In battle these Daedra are very much like their counterparts the
Golden Saints, except their weapons and armor are far more
dark and menacing. These daedra use very vampiric magicks
that siphon the life out of their foes, healing them in the process.
The Mazken are also very adept at preying on mortals by wearing
very revealing outfits and seducing them into their death (as
their nickname implies).Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a Dark Se-
ducer’s weapons and armor will be recoverable, otherwise
the Seducer’s body and equipment vanish back to Oblivion.
Dark Seducer arms and armor have the same enchant values
and weight as Malachite.
• Additionally, if slain while permanently bound to Mundus,
a character can make a -40 Alchemy test to salvage the
Daedra’s Heart, which is a Legendary Restoration ingredient.

142Ogrim
Ogrim are enormous Daedra with very little intellect, but which
are chiefly sent into the mortal world to menace living things for
the amusement of Daedra Princes. Ogrim are associated with Mala-
cath. They are known for their unnatural toughness.
Daedra; Major; White Soul (800)
Weapons and Armor
• Huge Fists:  2d8 Crushing; Concussive, Magic; Reach 2m
• Natural T oughness (6)
Special Abilities
• Hulking Fortitude (1 AP + 2 SP):  As a Reaction to taking
damage from a melee attack, the Ogrim can spend 2 Stamina
Points to negate all damage taken. If the attacking weapon
has the Impaling quality, the damage is only halved instead.
When a creature's melee attack is affected by this, they
become Dazed for one round as they stagger back. If the
weapon has the Impaling quality, the wielder must immediately
pass a +30 Luck test or else the weapon is stuck in the Ogrim's
rolling mounds of fat, and the character is disarmed. Re-
trieving the stuck weapon requires a Take Weapon special
action that the Ogrim does not oppose, but the character
must still succeed on their Unarmed or Athletics test.
T raits
• Dark Sight
• From Beyond
• Regeneration (6 + DoS): The Ogrim can test Endurance
for free at the start of each round to heal for 6 + DoS HP .
• Resistance (Normal Weapons, 5)
• Thick Skull: The Ogrim is immune to being Stunned and
Dazed.Encountering Ogrims
These lumbering, nipple-pierced Daedra can be found in the
service of Malacath mostly, but is sometimes affiliated with
other Daedric princes such as Molag Bal. They are very known
to harass mortals, and are very hard to kill because of their
natural resistance to non-magical weapons. Slow-witted, slow-
bodied, and ponderous creatures, they are nonetheless deadly
to any foolish enough to wander too closely to the monstrous
brutes. They are a perfect front-line force for any seasoned
conjurer.
Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a character
can test Alchemy at -10 to harvest the two Ogrim’s Horns,
which are each a Rare Alteration ingredient. If not Bound
to Mundus, the Ogrim simply vanishes.

143Scamp
Scamps are a common Daedric creature, known for their simple-
mindedness and cowardliness. Though smaller and weaker than
most other Daedra, they can still be a dangerous opponent, especially
when found in numbers. They are mischievous and cruel.

Special Abilities
• Mischief and Mayhem (1 SP):  After making a successful

target's Perception or Observe. If successful, the Scamp
manages to steal something of its choice.
• Gang Up (1 SP): When a Scamp makes a melee or spell
attack, they can increase the damage by +1 for each Scamp

Encountering Scamps
These tiny mischievous Daedra are renowned across Tamriel to
be the most annoying and irritating of all the Daedra (barring
Daedrats of course). They’re known to harass mortals more than
any other Daedra, as they burn down whatever comes in their
way with their fire spells. Scamps are mostly associated with
Mehrunes Dagon, but can be found doing errands for many of
the Daedric Princes in Oblivion.
In combat these small devils can be found casting fire spells
from a distance and when they get close, they climb on top of
their enemies, choking, biting, pulling hair, throwing sand in
eyes, and stealing items. One Scamp is no threat, two are a
handful, three is utter mayhem.
Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a character
can test Alchemy at -10 to harvest a dose of Scamp Skin,
which is a Rare Destruction ingredient, otherwise the Scamp
simply vanishes back to the realms of Oblivion.

action once per round at the start of their turn, or until a

Special Hit T able
Encountering Spider Daedra
This particular Daedra can be found in the service of Mephala,
and are some of the most vile Daedra to be found among her
realm. With how unpredictable and irrational they are, it would
almost make you think that Sheogorath may have had a hand
in making them.
They’re among the most powerful and dangerous Daedra to
fight as they can easily summon masses of Spiderlings to aid
them in battle while in Oblivion. As well as the poison that
they spit at their adversaries, which is caustic and causes the
target to move slower. This, in addition to their web-shooting
abilities, makes them very formidable and not something any
summoner should easily conjure up on a whim.
Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a character
can test Alchemy at -20 to harvest the Spider Daedra’s Silk
Gland, which is a Very Rare Mysticism ingredient.

“Spider Daedra. Hateful. Loathsome. But what if you're lost in their terrible realm? What if you don't know what to do? Then
you need them. I expected to be trussed up and slowly dissolved. But a befriending? Conversation? Joviality? Only if you believe
these scuttling hellions can feel compassion. They spin the web for Molag Bal. Their imagined aid only serrates my sanity. I am to
be coaxed off this cliff, not pushed. The Daedra. The cursed Daedra.”

• Barbed Tail:  2d8, Splitting, Magic, Impaling, 2m Reach

as a Grapple, and the Winged T wilight can choose to drop
the target at any point, causing the usual amount of falling
damage to be incurred.
• Refresh Spells (1 AP):  The twilight can spend a Stamina
Point to either regain magicka points up to half their MP
max or refresh all their used spellcasts used with the Spellcaster
trait.T raits

Spells
• Shock Bolt 3: 8 MP; 1d8 Shock; Ranged (100m), Attack,
Overload (+WB to dmg)
• Shock Bolt 4: 10 MP; 1d10 Shock; Ranged (100m), Attack,
Overload (+WB to dmg)

Encountering Wings
Winged T wilights are associated mostly with the Daedric Prince
Azura, as they are her primary messengers, and minions. They
have large bat-like wings for arms, and have resistances to most
types of magic damage. The tail of this Daedra is probably its
most formidable feature, as it is the Winged T wilight’s primary
means of attack. If the tail is wounded though, the Winded
Twilight must rely on it’s claws and natural spellcasting. This
Daedra is another of the few summoned only by seasoned
conjurers.
Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a character
can test Alchemy at -40 to harvest up to 3 doses of T wilight
Poison, which are each a Legendary Destruction ingredient.
The character salvages up to their DoS on the Alchemy test,
maximum of 3.

Encountering Xivilai
A race of tall, muscular, and grey-skinned daedra, the Xivilai is
notable for being a free daedra, not bound to any prince. They
may be found under the service of any prince however, as they
may be persuaded into joining their ranks.
Xivilai society is without castes like that of the Dremora, and
it values strength and power above all things. Scheming, back-
stabbing, and betrayal are extremely common in their ruthless
society. They live within their own area of Oblivion, within the
sway of Peryite. In battle, they will usually summon a clannfear,
and stay back blasting with their powerful spells until they feel
the time to charge into melee is right.
Loot
• If slain while permanently bound to Mundus, a Xivilai’s
weapons and armor will be recoverable, otherwise the Xivilai’s
body and equipment vanish back to Oblivion.
• Additionally, if slain while permanently bound to Mundus,
a character can make a -40 Alchemy test to salvage the
Daedra’s Heart, which is a Legendary Restoration ingredient.Characteristics Attributes Skills

“Ah, the Xivilai. Are there any Daedra, in all the infinite worlds of Oblivion, more pompous and filled with unwarranted conceit
than those impertinent and unruly louts? It is true that their combination of brute strength and low cunning makes them effective
agents in certain rare situations, but for most purposes they are sadly unreliable.”
