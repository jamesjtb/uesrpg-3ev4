  description: >-
    <p>The ritual allows the Tongue to imbue a ritually prepared rope of his
    enemies tongues with a part of his power, allowing him limited use of his
    Voice, even if</p>

    <p>otherwise prevented from doing so, like being on the brink of exhaustion
    or somehow robbed of the ability to speak.</p>

    <p>Creating the Rope itself requires no test, but the creator must have the
    tongues of three powerful and worthy foes, fresh Heartwood from a Spriggan
    (Extremely Rare Restoration ingredient) for smoking the meat, drying it out
    while giving it life, and Ice Wraith Essence (Very Rare Restoration /
    Destruction ingredient) to preserve it from rot.</p>

    <p>With the rope created, it must next imbued with one or more words of
    power from a single shout that the Tongue knows. Choose the desired Word(s)
    of the Shout and perform the appropriate Thu&rsquo;um test as if using that
    shout, but with an added -10 penalty to each word beyond the first. If the
    test is successful, the draconic runes representing the word(s) of the shout
    appear on the length of rope, indicating that the ritual was a success.</p>

    <p>The character then fills out the profile of the Gron-Sik by writing down
    the following information:</p>

    <p>&bull; The chosen name for the Gron-Sik (Usually Gron-Sik of &lsquo;shout
    name&rsquo;).</p>

    <p>&bull; The word(s) of the chosen shout imbued in the Gron-Sik.</p>

    <p>&bull; The amount of DoS scored in the Imbuement, henceforth known as
    Binding Strength.</p>

    <p>&bull; The word &ldquo;Ties&rdquo; and a blank space in which to note a
    number.</p>

    <p>The Gron-Sik can be activated with the Cast Magic action, spending one if
    its Ties to power all words of the shout, which automatically counts as
    having succeeded with a number of DoS equal to its Binding Strength. If a
    shout requires an Opposed Roll, use the wielders Willpower Bonus.</p>

    <p>To power the Gron-Sik, the Tongue must give it a Stamina Point for each
    Tie desired. This can be done as part of a Long Rest, but as long as the
    Stamina Points are Tied to the Gron-Sik, it cannot be recovered by any
    means, neither ordinary or magical.</p>
