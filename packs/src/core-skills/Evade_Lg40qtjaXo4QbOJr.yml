    <p>Evade measures a character&rsquo;s ability to escape from observed,
    impending danger through the use of fluid movement and quick reaction times.
    This skill is most often used to defend against attacks in combat, or to
    avoid other physical dangers. Your GM may ask you to test Evade when you try
    to accomplish tasks like the following...</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Duck beneath an incoming spell</li>

    <li>Dodge a sword swing</li>

    <li>Avoid falling debris</li>

    <li>Stay out of reach of multiple attackers</li>
