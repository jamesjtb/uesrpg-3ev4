If an attacker with this weapon and a defender blocking with a shield both pass their respective tests, and the attackerâ€™s degrees of success exceed those of the defender, then the defender does not block the attack as they normally would and the attack is resolved as if the attacker had won. If a character critically fails an attack with a flail they hit themselves.\_</p>"
