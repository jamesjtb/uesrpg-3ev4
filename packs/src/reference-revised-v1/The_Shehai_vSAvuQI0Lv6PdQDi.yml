        <p>In game terms, the Shehai may be manifested in structured time with
        the use of the Cast Magic Secondary action and a Shehai Shen She Ru (WP)
        skill test, the difficulty of which will vary with the desired Shehai
        level. Characters must have the appropriate talent in order to manifest
        a Shehai of a given level.</p>

        <p>• Manifesting a Shehai of the First Level Requires: a Shehai Shen She
        Ru (WP) skill test with a -10 penalty. Failing the manifestation roll
        costs the Swordsinger a Stamina Point.</p>

        <p>• Manifesting a Shehai of the Second Level Requires: a Shehai Shen
        She Ru (WP) skill test with a -20 penalty. Failing the manifestation
        roll costs the Swordsinger two Stamina Points.</p>

        <p>• Manifesting a Shehai of the third Level Requires: a Shehai Shen She
        Ru (WP) skill test with a -40 penalty. Failing the manifestation roll
        costs the Swordsinger three Stamina Points.</p>

        <p>On success, the character manifests the Shehai in an open hand. The
        weapon type of the manifested Shehai is determined in advance when the
        character purchases the necessary talent. A Shehai persists until the
        character dismisses it, or for a number of hours equal to the
        character’s Willpower bonus minus the level of the Shehai. A Shehai
        cannot be taken from the character in any way, and it may not be thrown
        without dissipating, as it is bound by his will. The Shehai is
        transparent, but is very much capable of interacting with physical
        objects: it can make attacks, applies all weapon qualities normally, and
        be defended against normally.</p>

        <p><strong>Shehai of the First Level</strong></p>

        <p>A Shehai of this level may vaguely resemble a certain weapon, but it
        is very weak. Use the base weapon profile for the chosen weapon type,
        but add half the character’s unmodified (by magic, enchantments etc.)
        Willpower bonus (round up) to the damage, and give the weapon the Magic
        and Primitive qualities.</p>

        <p><strong>Shehai of the Second Level</strong></p>

        <p>A Shehai of this level is clearly a weapon, and is quite potent. Use
        the base weapon profile for the chosen weapon type, but add the
        character’s unmodified (by magic, enchantments etc.) Willpower bonus to
        the damage of the weapon, and give the weapon the Magic quality.</p>

        <p><strong>Shehai of the Third Level</strong></p>

        <p>A Shehai of this level is a legendary weapon of incredible power. Use
        the base weapon profile for the chosen weapon type, but add twice the
        character’s unmodified (by magic, enchantments etc.) Willpower bonus to
        the damage of the weapon, and give the weapon the Magic quality.</p>
