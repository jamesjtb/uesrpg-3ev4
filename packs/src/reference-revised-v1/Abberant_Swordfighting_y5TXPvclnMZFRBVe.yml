        <p>The abilities that a student of Aberrant Swordsmanship can learn are
        known simply as Techniques. Using a technique Requires: a sword of some
        kind, either a physical one or a Shehai, and the</p>

        <p>use of the Shehai Shen She Ru skill. Some techniques are passive
        abilities, while others are active.</p>

        <p>Techniques count as magic, though they are not spells, and should
        thus be placed in the appropriate section of your character sheet.
        Characters may learn techniques with XP. Once a character has learned a
        technique, he may use it whenever he wants. Some techniques require that
        characters already know other techniques, or meet certain characteristic
        score requirements, before they may be learned or used.</p>

        <p>There are two types of techniques: passive techniques and active
        techniques. Passive techniques simply apply some kind of bonus or effect
        to the character once they have been learned, though some of them must
        be activated (as free actions at the beginning of a turn or round) in
        order to provide their effect, and a character must be wielding some
        kind of sword in order to benefit. Active techniques are specific
        abilities that must be used, and call for a skill test.</p>

        <p>During structured time, active techniques may be utilized with the
        Cast Magic Primary or Secondary action depending on the technique in
        question unless otherwise specified. Any attacks they do win Advantage
        as normal, and they do not allow for attacks of opportunity. Using an
        active technique Requires: that the character follow these steps:</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Choose Technique</strong></p>

        <p>First, the sword-singer must choose a technique to utilize. They may
        only choose a technique that they have learned, and that they meet the
        requirements for.</p>

        <p>A character must be wielding a sword of some kind in order to utilize
        techniques.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Make Technique Test</strong></p>

        <p>Next, the character makes a Shehai Shen She Ru skill (WP) skill
        test.</p>

        <p>This test is modified by the technique’s difficulty as specified in
        the technique’s profile.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Resolve Technique</strong></p>

        <p>If the technique test was successful, apply the effects of the
        technique as specified in the technique’s profile.</p>

        <p>If the character failed the technique test, they lose X Stamina
        Points, where X is equal to the 10s digit of the Technique’s difficulty
        (to a minimum of 1 Stamina Point).</p>

        <p><strong>Techniques</strong></p>

        <p>This section gives an overview of each technique of Aberrant
        Swordsmanship that a character may learn. A character can only use
        techniques that he meets the requirements for. Characters who meet these
        requirements may learn techniques with XP. Remember that techniques
        count as magic, though they are not spells.</p>
