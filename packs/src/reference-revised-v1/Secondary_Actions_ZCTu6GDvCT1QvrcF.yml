      content: "<p>Secondary Actions can only be taken during the character’s own turn or as reactions. They are combat actions that require less dedication from the character and can be taken somewhat reactively to battlefield circumstances. A character may take any number of these.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Aim</strong></p>\n<p>A character can spend an action aiming in order to gain a +10 bonus to their next ranged attack. This bonus can stack if the character takes this action multiple consecutive times before their next ranged attack, but only up to three times (for a maximum bonus of +30). The “chain” can stretch across rounds and is broken (and the bonus lost) if the character makes an attack with anything else they aren’t aiming with, or takes any actions or reactions other than to continue aiming or fire the aimed ranged attack. This action can be used by a spellcaster to modify ranged attack spells.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Cast Magic (non-attack only)</strong></p>\n<p>The character casts a spell that they know using the rules for spellcasting found in Chapter 6. This may not be used to cast spells that count as attacks.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Dash</strong></p>\n<p>The character can use this action in order to move up to their speed. If this is done on their turn, this movement is added to their base movement for that turn. This action can be used to allow a character to move several times their speed during a round.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Hide</strong></p>\n<p>The character can use this action to attempt to hide from foes. If anyone might detect them while they do this, they must make a Stealth skill test opposed by the Observe of anyone who might spot them. On success, they gain the Hidden condition.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Ready Weapon / Drink Potion</strong></p>\n<p>The character may draw, sheath, withdraw, or reload a weapon. This action may also be used to drink a potion, assuming it is accessible to the character, but this costs 2 AP instead. Some missile weapons may require several AP to reload, in which case this action must be extended.</p>"
