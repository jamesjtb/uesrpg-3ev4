        <p>If a character is reduced to 0 Hit Points remaining then they fall
        unconscious. A character who is unconscious at 0 HP must pass an
        Endurance test on their turn. If they fail a number of tests in excess
        of their Luck bonus while unconscious, then they die. Taking damage at
        least once causes the character to fail the next test. If an effect
        would Stabilize them (this can be done with a Survival or Profession
        [Medicine] skill test and a healerâ€™s kit) or bring them above 0 HP, then
        they stop testing.</p>
