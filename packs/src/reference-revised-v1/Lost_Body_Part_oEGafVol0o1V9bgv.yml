        <p>The character loses a part of their body. A character can have
        multiple instances of this condition at once, each affecting a different
        body part. If an attack would hit a body part that has been entirely
        lost, the attack hits the body location instead. This condition applies
        additional penalties that vary based on the body part. In the case of
        the head, there is a choice between an ear or an eye (GM’s
        decision).</p>

        <p><strong>Lost Ear</strong></p>

        <p>The character has had their ear removed or destroyed, and their
        hearing damaged. They suffers the following penalties:</p>

        <p>• All tests that rely on hearing are made with a -20 penalty.</p>

        <p>• If both ears are lost, the character gains the deafened condition
        permanently.</p>

        <p><strong>Lost Eye</strong></p>

        <p>The character has had their eye removed or destroyed and suffers the
        following penalties:</p>

        <p>• All tests that rely on sight are made with a -20 penalty.</p>

        <p>• If both eyes are lost, the character gains the blinded condition
        permanently.</p>

        <p><strong>Lost Foot/Leg</strong></p>

        <p>The character has had their leg severed somewhere between the ankle
        and the hip, and suffers the following penalties.</p>

        <p>• Gain the slowed condition permanently.</p>

        <p>• All tests that rely on the use of two legs are made with a -20
        penalty.</p>

        <p>• If both legs are lost, gain the Immobilized condition permanently
        and fail any tests that rely entirely on movement.</p>

        <p><strong>Lost Hand/Arm</strong></p>

        <p>The character has had their arm severed somewhere between the wrist
        and the shoulder, and suffers the following penalties:</p>

        <p>• Can no longer use two-handed weapons, shields (if the whole arm is
        missing), or one handed weapons in that arm.</p>

        <p>• All tests that rely on the use of two hands are made with a -20
        penalty.</p>

        <p>• If both hands are lost, the character cannot wield weapons and
        automatically fails all tests that rely on the use of hands.</p>

        <p><strong>Organ Damage (Lost Body Part: Body)</strong></p>

        <p>The character has had an internal organs damaged. Characters with
        this condition heal damage at half speed and increase the passive wound
        penalty to all tests to -30.</p>
