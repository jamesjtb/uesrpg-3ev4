        <p>The character is flung into an uncontrollable rage. Frenzied
        characters gain the following rules:</p>

        <p>• Must attempt to attack the nearest enemy in melee combat each turn
        if able. May only make All Out Attacks.</p>

        <p>• If not in range of the nearest enemy, must move towards that enemy.
        May not attempt to flee the fight.</p>

        <p>• Increase SB by 1.</p>

        <p>• Suffer a -20 penalty to all skill tests based on anything except
        Strength, Agility, or Endurance.</p>

        <p>• Gains an extra SP, which can exceed their SP maximum.</p>

        <p>• Immune to the effects of the stunned condition, fear, and passive
        wound effects.</p>

        <p>Once the encounter has ended, the character snaps out of their
        frenzied state and loses 2 SP (this cannot kill them). The character can
        also test Willpower at a -20 as an action during combat to attempt to
        snap out of frenzy, which ends the condition.</p>
