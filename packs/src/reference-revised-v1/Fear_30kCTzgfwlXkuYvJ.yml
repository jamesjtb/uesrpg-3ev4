      content: "<p>When a character is confronted by such a frightening event or adversary they must take a Fear Test. There are two types of fear tests: panic and horror tests.</p>\n<p>Fear tests are Willpower tests that use a special notation, either Panic (+/- X) or Horror (+/- X), where X is the bonus or penalty applied to the test. If the character fails the test, they succumb to the effects of fear.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>Your GM may call on you to make a Panic Test when you are confronted by mundane shock or horror. This is represented by the Panic (+/- X) notation, which is simply a Willpower test with a +/- X modifier.</p>\n<p>Your GM may call on you to make a Horror Test when you are confronted by supernatural terrors. This is represented by the Horror (+/- X) notation, which is simply a Willpower test with a +/- X modifier. In general, horror tests with any sort of penalty should be reserved for the most terrifying monsters and mind melting terrors.</p>"
