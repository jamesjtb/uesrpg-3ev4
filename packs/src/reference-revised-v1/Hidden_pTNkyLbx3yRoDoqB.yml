Characters must spend 2 meters of their movement for the round for each 1 meter that they actually move while hidden, and cannot Dash. Enemies cannot attempt to defend themselves against the attacks of hidden characters, but attacking causes a character to lose this condition immediately afterwards.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>If a hidden character would enter line of sight of at least one character from whom they have not previously hidden, they must make a Stealth test opposed by that characterâ€™s Observe. On success, or if they achieve more degrees of success, they remain hidden. Otherwise that character becomes aware of them.</p>"
