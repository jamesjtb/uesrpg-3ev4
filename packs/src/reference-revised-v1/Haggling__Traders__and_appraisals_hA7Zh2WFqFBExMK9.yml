      content: "<p><strong>Haggling for a Bargain</strong></p>\n<p>Bargaining is a part of everyday life, and almost expected amongst professional merchants. Should a character wish to bargain with a merchant for the price of their wares, roll an opposed Commerce Test against the merchant.</p>\n<p>For every Degree of Success the character scores above the merchant, a 5% discount is gained.</p>\n<p>If the merchant wins the Commerce test, increase the price by 5% per Degree of success instead.</p>\n<p>A character can always choose to not accept a bad bargain, but a local market is a living, breathing thing and word travels fast about bad customers. Should a character deny a ‘bargain’ and go elsewhere, the GM can choose to apply a penalty equal to the % of the bargain that was denied.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Unscrupulous Traders</strong></p>\n<p>Certain merchants can be particularly unscrupulous in their bargaining, either due to holding a monopoly on a certain ware, or being a position that allows them to press their hapless victim for an extra fee like a fence giving less for stolen goods, well knowing that the prospective seller has nowhere else to go. When bargaining with such unscrupulous types, the GM can choose to apply a penalty ranging from -10 to -40 to the characters Commerce Test when bargaining for a better price on their goods.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Appraising an Item</strong></p>\n<p>Not knowing the current market value of certain goods has been the bane of many a haggler.</p>\n<p>If a character wishes to assert the price of an object of interest before going for the bargain, roll a Commerce Test with a modifier equal to the items rarity (see Availability Modifiers on page 108) to see if they can learn the current rates.</p>\n<p>On a success, the character gains a +10 bonus to their attempt at haggling.</p>\n<p>On a failure however, add a -5 penalty per Degree of Failure to their attempt at haggling, as they have misinterpreted the current trend of the market.</p>"
