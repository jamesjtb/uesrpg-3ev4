        <p><strong>Learning Words of Power</strong></p>

        <p>Characters with the Thu’um skill trained may unlock the ability to
        use a given word of power with XP assuming that they have somehow
        learned the word of power during their adventures (meaning that the GM
        has control over which words the character may access at any given
        time).</p>

        <p>This represents the time spent to come to understand the nature of
        the word, and the practice required to be able to utilize it in a Shout.
        Learning a given word of power and the way it fits into a specific Shout
        without aid of some kind costs 200 XP per level of the Word (for
        example, the first word in a Shout would be 200 XP, the second 400 XP,
        etc.). Characters who have access to a guide (a teacher, an ancient
        text, or some other aid) during this process halve the cost.</p>

        <p><strong>Using the Thu’um</strong></p>

        <p>Using the Thu’um requires two things: the character must be trained
        in the Thu’um skill, and have knowledge of a Word of Power. Words of
        power make up Shouts, which are similar to spells.</p>

        <p>Characters may use Shouts with the Cast Magic Primary action. It is
        important to note, however, that using a Shout as a Cast Magic action
        does not provoke an Attack of Opportunity. There is simply no time to
        react to the Shout in a way that could stop its effects.</p>

        <p>Additionally, there’s more to using the Thu’um than just saying a few
        words: Shouting requires concentration and power. Each Shout has three
        words, and while speaking the first word is sufficient to produce an
        effect, each additional word adds more power to the Shout (but also
        requires more skill and energy to use).</p>

        <p>A given Shout may not be used in two consecutive rounds. Once a
        character uses a Shout, they may not use that Shout again for a number
        of rounds equal to the number of words used in the Shout.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Choose Shout and Target</strong></p>

        <p>First, the character must declare the shout being used (specifically
        the number of words), and the target of the shout (if applicable). A
        character may only use a shout if they know the first word of that
        shout, and they may only use further words if they know those as
        well.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Make Thu’um Test</strong></p>

        <p>Next, the caster makes a Thu’um skill test, the difficulty of which
        is determined by the shout the character has chosen. If the character
        passes the test, they successfully manifest the shout. If they fail,
        nothing happens. Either way, proceed to step 3. A critical success means
        no stamina is spent for the attempt so you may skip step 3 in this
        case.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Spend Stamina</strong></p>

        <p>Attempting a shout takes a lot of energy, and the character is left
        drained afterwards. Characters who attempt a shout must spend one
        Stamina Point for each word used in the shout beyond the first. If a
        character fails a Shout, regardless of the number of words in the Shout,
        they lose one Stamina Point.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Apply Effects</strong></p>

        <p>If the Thu’um test was successful, apply the effects of the shout to
        the target as specified in the shout profile, and based on the number of
        words the character used.</p>
