      content: "<p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>\n<p>Constant enchantments are passive enchantments that can be applied to any sort of item, and that constantly affect the wearer or wielder of that item. In game terms, constant enchantments apply their effects to the character wearing/wielding them at the start of each round (regardless of their normal duration). If the effect is dispelled, it returns to full functionality after 1d4 rounds. Constant enchantments do not need to be recharged like cast enchantments and have no soul energy pool. The wearer or wielder of a constant enchantment can willingly disable or re-enable its effects at any time using the Cast Magic secondary action.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Effects &amp; Forms</strong></p>\n<p>A character may attempt to create a constant enchantment using any effect from any school as long as that effect has the Upkeep Attribute, and a listed duration. It is not dependent on their knowledge of any spells.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Multi Effect Enchantments</strong></p>\n<p>Characters can create constant enchantments that have more than one effect (to a maximum of 3) but these enchantments are more difficult to create, and characters require a talent to attempt it.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Reference Materials</strong></p>\n<p>The complete list of effects can be found on the page below.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Choose Item</strong></p>\n<p>First the enchanter must pick an item to enchant. Constant enchantments can be applied to any item, but only some items will have an enchantment level high enough to reasonably support more powerful enchantments. Items without a listed enchantment level have an EL of 0.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Soul Gem</strong></p>\n<p>Next the enchanter must pick the soul gem they will use for the enchantment. This gem must have an ES equal to or greater than the EL of the item. Once a soul gem has been used to create an enchantment it is destroyed and any excess energy is lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Constant Effect(s)</strong></p>\n<p>Constant enchantments are not created using the normal spell making rules. Instead, the enchanter simply picks the effect(s) they want and compares the combined enchantment strength(s) of their chosen effects to the table on the page below.</p>\n<p>Every effect has an EL min, this is the minimum enchantment level an item must have in order to use that effect. The enchantment strength chosen for the effect must be less than or equal to the enchantment strength of the soul gem used. Add the enchantment strength of any enchantments used when calculating multiple enchantments.</p>\n<p>If the soul gem has enough enchantment strength to power the enchantment, then they can attempt to create it, otherwise it is impossible as the enchantment cannot sustain itself on so little energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Create the Enchantment</strong></p>\n<p>Now the enchanter can attempt to create the enchantment. This requires a ritual that lasts approximately eight hours, and consumes materials worth approximately 100 drakes. The enchanter then makes an enchant skill test with a -10 penalty for each level by which the total enchantment strength of the chosen effect(s) exceeds their enchant skill rank (if applicable).</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Finalize Enchantment</strong></p>\n<p>Regardless of the outcome of the tests, the soul gem is destroyed and its energy is lost. If the enchanter passes a test then they successfully create the enchanted item. Be sure to write down the effect(s) of the enchantment for reference.</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1477%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:19.0201%\"><strong>Name</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:72.1389%\"><strong>Effect (ES = Enchantment Strength)</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:7.98149%\"><strong>EL min</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:19.0201%\">Elemental Armour</td>\n<td style=\"width:72.1389%\">Affected target gains ES AR of the chosen [type]</td>\n<td style=\"width:7.98149%\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:19.0201%\">Magic Armour</td>\n<td style=\"width:72.1389%\">Affected target gains (ES-3) magic AR</td>\n<td style=\"width:7.98149%\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:19.0201%\">Armour</td>\n<td style=\"width:72.1389%\">Affected target gains (ES-1) AR</td>\n<td style=\"width:7.98149%\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:19.0201%\">Feather</td>\n<td style=\"width:72.1389%\">Affected target lowers its encumbrance level by one, and treats its armour as being one weight class lighter.
