        <p>Much like people, gear does not always survive combat. In the event
        that a weapon or piece of armor is damaged, a character can attempt to
        repair it with a Profession [Smithing] skill test. This takes about an
        hour and requires raw materials worth five percent of the price of the
        item. Given a successful skill test, the character can reduce the X
        value of the Damaged (X) weapon/armor quality on the damaged item by
        their degrees of success.</p>
