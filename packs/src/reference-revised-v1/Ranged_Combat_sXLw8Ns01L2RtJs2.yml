      content: "<p>Ranged combat is any form of combat that happens at a distance with weapons which must be shot, thrown, or slung at their target. The ranged weapons a character can use are listed as part</p>\n<p>of their Combat Style skills.</p>\n<p>Ranged attacks are resolved similarly to melee attacks, except they cannot be parried or counter attacked. Ranged attackers cannot gain or utilize advantage. Ranged weapons have unique attributes that distinguish them from melee weapons:</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>Range for ranged weapons is defined in terms of three numbers instead of just one, representing the maximum close, effective, and long ranges of the weapon or its ammunition. Attacking targets in close range provides a +10 bonus to attack tests with the weapon, while attacking targets at long range imposes a -20 penalty.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>Reload represents the number of AP required to reload a weapon which fires ammunition. This requires the use of the ready weapon action.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>Ranged Combat Circumstance Modifiers Like all tests, tests made in ranged combat should always be subject to difficulty based on the environment or circumstances in which the combat is happening. Disadvantageous circumstances can be rated in a simple scale by the GM, and should not usually be worse than -30.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1549%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:47.6765%\"><strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ Modifier</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:51.6132%\"><strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ Common Examples</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:47.6765%\">Minor Disadvantage (-10)</td>\n<td style=\"width:51.6132%\">Firing in light wind</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:47.6765%\">Disadvantage (-20)</td>\n<td style=\"width:51.6132%\">Firing in moderate wind, target prone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:47.6765%\">Major Disadvantage</td>\n<td style=\"width:51.6132%\">Firing in heavy wind or low visibility</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Firing while Mounted</strong></p>\n<p>A character can use ranged weapons even while mounted, however their Combat Style skill is limited by the Ride skill of the personal controlling the mount (if their Combat Style rank exceeds their Ride skill rank, use their Ride skill rank instead).</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Area of Effect Attacks</strong></p>\n<p>Some ranged attacks, typically spells, affect an area. Area of effect attacks that cause damage can only be defended against by evading or blocking, and only if the character is aware of the incoming attack.</p>\n<p>On a successful defense, either a block or an evade, the character halves the incoming damage (round up) before resolving the effects. Additionally, on a successful evade, the character may move a single meter in any direction. If this would carry them outside the range of the area of effect, they are not affected at all.</p>\n<p>Area of effect attacks are resolved against the body.</p>"
