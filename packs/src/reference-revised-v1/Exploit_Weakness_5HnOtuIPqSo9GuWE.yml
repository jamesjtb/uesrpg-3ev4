        <p>These weapons are small and able to slip into gaps in a target’s
        defenses. Attacks with this weapon treat full armor as partial armor,
        and partial armor as unarmored (but do not actually reduce the
        location’s AR). This can be used to trigger effects, such as Slashing,
        that interact with the level of armor the target is wearing.</p>
