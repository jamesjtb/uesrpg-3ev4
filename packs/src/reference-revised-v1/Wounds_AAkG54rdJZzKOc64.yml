      content: "<p>Wounds represent devestating injuries caused by more damaging attacks, and not just simple cuts and bruises. If a character ever drops to 0 HP or is hit by a critical success then they take a wound. Record the amount of damage and hit location, then follow these steps:</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Shock Test</strong></p>\n<p>First, the character must make a special Endurance test known as a Shock Test, which represents how well the character fares against the initial effects.</p>\n<p>• If the wound is to the body, the character loses an action point. If they have none remaining, they begin their next turn with one less. If they fail the shock test then they also suffer the crippled body condition.</p>\n<p>• If the wound is to a limb then the character suffers the crippled limb condition (blows to the head instead stun for 1 round). If they fail the shock test then they also suffer the lost limb condition (lost ear or lost eye for the head). If the wound was caused by magic damage, the following applies:</p>\n<p>• If the wound is from fire damage, the character also must pass an Agility test or gain the Burning (1) condition.</p>\n<p>• If the wound is from frost, the character also much pass a Endurance test or gain the Dazed condition</p>\n<p>• If the wound is from poison damage, the character loses a Stamina point.</p>\n<p>• If the wound is from shock or magic damage, the character also loses Magicka points equal to the damage inflicted.</p>"
