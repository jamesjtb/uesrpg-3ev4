      content: "<p><strong>Step 1: Determine Item and modifications</strong></p>\n<p>First, the character must choose the item they wish to create. Some items cannot be created, such as those that only occur naturally, so the GM should use discretion when determining if a character can craft an item. The character must also choose the quality of the item, if applicable, which when combined with the item’s base price will allow them to determine the approximate market value of the item.</p>\n<p>When an item has been chosen, pick one or more modifications\_from the Weapon, Armor or Shield table below, which specifies\_the effect and difficulty of each. The number of upgrades that\_can be applied to the item (every level of scaled upgrades counts\_toward this level) is equal to half the characters Profession Smith\_rank rounded up (1 for rank 1, 3 for rank 5).</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Gather Raw Materials and modification materials</strong></p>\n<p>Next the character must gather the raw materials necessary to create the item. Exactly what this entails will vary from item to item, but as a general rule of thumb if the character wishes to purchase all the raw materials it will cost roughly one third of the item’s price as calculated in the last step.</p>\n<p>The character must also gather the necessary materials for the modifications, following the same guidelines as above. The general rule of thumb is that if the character wishes to purchase all the raw materials for the upgrades, it will cost roughly one fifth of the item’s base price as calculated in the last step for each modification (including levels) applied.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Determine and modify Test Difficulty</strong></p>\n<p>Third the character determines the difficulty of the crafting test. The difficulty of the crafting test for most items is based solely on the quality of the item, and modified further as the GM sees fit. When creating weapons or armor the material also provides amodifier. See the tables below for test difficulties.</p>\n<p>After determining the initial test difficulty, add the relevant modifiers from any applied modifications to determine the final test difficulty that will be used in Step 4.</p>\n<table style=\"width:37.7868%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:44.5438%\"><strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ Quality</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:54.7459%\"><strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_Difficulty</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:44.5438%\">Inferior</td>\n<td style=\"width:54.7459%\">+30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:44.5438%\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"width:54.7459%\">+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:44.5438%\">Superior</td>\n<td style=\"width:54.7459%\">-30</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\_</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1477%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\"><strong>Material</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\"><strong>Difficulty</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\"><strong>Material</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">\n<p><strong>Difficulty</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Adamantium</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">-20</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Leather</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">+10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Bonemold</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">-5</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Malachite</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">-20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Bone</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Mithril</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">-10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Chitin</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Moonstone</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">-10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Dragonbone</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">-40</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Orichalcum</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">-10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Dreugh Hide</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">-10</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Padded</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">+30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Dwemer</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">-10</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Silver</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">-5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Ebony</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">-30</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Stahlrim</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">-10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Fur</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Steel</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Iron</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">+20</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Wood</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">+20</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Make Crafting Test</strong></p>\n<p>Next the character makes the actual crafting test using the difficulty determined in the previous step. The skill that the character tests is based on the item they wish to craft. Creating weapons or armor uses the Profession [Smithing] skill, while other items will usually use some other variation of the Profession [Field] skill as appropriate. Failure produces no item, while critical success halves the time required.</p>\n<p>Creating any item requires the appropriate craft tools. In the case of smithing, the character will also need access to a forge (along with the related facilities and tools) in order to complete the product. The actual act of crafting can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days (and sometimes even longer). During this time the character must be focused on creating the item. The duration required is left to the GM, and should be based on the complexity of the item in question.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Runed Weapons/Armor</strong></p>\n<p>Characters with knowledge of Enchanting can imbue weapons and armor with magic runes that make them effective against certain types of enemies. The character must pass an Enchant test when creating the item (there is no penalty for failure). On success add the Magic weapon/armor quality.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Reforging</strong></p>\n<p>A smith can chose to reuse any existing weapon or armor when creating something new, regardless of how damaged it has become.</p>\n<p>To do so, find the price for an unmodified item of its type and mark down 1/3rd of its price (100 drakes for a Full Chest plate of steel worth 300 for example). You now have materials worth that much that can be spend on creating any item made from the same material, and multiple items can be broken down to provide enough materials for the crafting roll. Daedric items cannot be reforged this way, and will simply turn to dust if attempted.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Smithing Services</strong></p>\n<p>Custom crafted arms and armor can be extremely versatile, and extremely expensive. Characters can hire smiths to create items with upgrades of all types. Their cost is determined by the following formula:</p>\n<p><strong>Customized Item Price: Item + Upgrades + Fee</strong></p>\n<p>The cost for Upgrades is determined by the combined number of upgrades / upgrade levels wished for, 1 increases the cost of the base item by 20%, 2 by 50% and 3 by 100%.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the table below provides a guideline for the flat fee charged by the smith based on the final difficulty modifier of the chosen upgrades combined.</p>"
