Characters are always capable of attempting to fight in this manner, even if they do not have a Combat Style skill that includes unarmed combat, they do so by rolling a test against their Strength or Agility, with the standard -20 penalty for using an untrained skill.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>A character’s natural weapons use the profile specified below unless the character has the Natural Weapons (*) trait (which overrides the default profile). If a character has a Combat Style that includes unarmed combat, that skill can be used for attacks with the character’s natural weapons. Natural weapons ignore rules regarding one, two, or hand and a half weapons, and cannot be disarmed.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1549%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:27.5398%\"><strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_Type</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:36.1611%\"><strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ Damage</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:35.4468%\"><strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_Range</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:27.5398%\">Punches/Kicks</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.1611%\">1D4</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.4468%\">1m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:27.5398%\">Claws</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.1611%\">1D4; Slashing</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.4468%\">1m</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Parrying/Counter Attacking while Unarmed</strong></p>\n<p>If an unarmed combatant is facing an opponent with a weapon with a longer range and they are within their own engagement range, then they can attempt to parry that weapon’s attacks, or counter attack.
