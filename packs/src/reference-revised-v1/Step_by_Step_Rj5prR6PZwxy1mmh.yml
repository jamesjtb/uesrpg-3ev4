      content: "<p><strong>Step 1: Attack</strong></p>\n<p>• Melee Weapon Attacks: The attacker makes a Combat Style test using either Strength or Agility against a target within the range of their weapon.</p>\n<p>• Ranged Weapon Attacks: The attacker makes a Combat Style test using Agility against a target within the range of their weapon.</p>\n<p>• Cast Magic Attacks: The attacker caster makes a skill test with the skill corresponding to the school of the spell.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Defend</strong></p>\n<p>• Evade: The defender rolls an Evade test (Agility).</p>\n<p>• Parry: Melee weapons or shields may be used to parry melee attacks. The defender makes the Combat Style test using Strength or Agility.</p>\n<p>• Block: Shields may be used to block ranged or melee attacks. The defender makes a Combat Style test using Strength.</p>\n<p>• Counter-Attack: The characters both attempt to strike the other while parrying their opponent’s blows. The defender also makes a melee attack, using the rules above. Both characters count as “attackers” in step 3.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Roll Tests &amp; Determine Result</strong></p>\n<p>• Both characters fail: In the event that both characters fail their tests, nothing happens and any AP used is spent.</p>\n<p>• 1 character fails: The winner gains an advantage (if melee and attacking).</p>\n<p>• Attacker wins: The attack is successful, the attacker chooses how to utilize their advantage, and resolves it.</p>\n<p>• Defender wins: The defense is successful, and in most cases doesn’t take any damage. The defender chooses how to utilize their advantage and resolve it.</p>\n<p>• Both characters pass: No characters gain an advantage.</p>\n<p>• Attack vs. Block: The defender blocks the attack regardless of attacker degrees of success. Resolve the block using the rules in Step 4 as if the defender won.</p>\n<p>• Attack vs. Parry or Evade: The defense is negated if the attacker has more degrees of success. Resolve the attack.</p>\n<p>• Counter-Attack: Whichever character achieves more degrees of success hits the other. If both characters achieve the same amount of degrees of success, then nothing happens.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Resolve Attack &amp; Advantages</strong></p>\n<p>Refer to @JournalEntry[KOaVm4gDbi4gQUL3]{Damage &amp; Hit Locations}.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>Attacker Won</p>\n<p>The attack hits the target and deals damage. If the target’s armor values differ across hit locations, then check to see where it hit using the ones digit of the attack roll or a d10 (count 10 as 0). (You can often skip this step entirely or delay it until it is necessary).</p>\n<p>Next, resolve any advantage gained from the combat roll (@JournalEntry[wu5Gcc2Hjn2JFtR2]{Advantages}). Then roll the damage of the attack and subtract the Armor Rating (AR) of the hit location struck. Reduce the target’s HP by the remaining amount. Some types of AR only mitigate certain types of damage. If the attack was a critical success, or the damage drops the character to 0 HP, it has also caused a wound. See Physical Health for details.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>Defender won</p>\n<p>Resolve defense based on result:</p>\n<p>• Evade: If an attack is evaded it is negated entirely. The character may move up to 1 meter in any direction for free.</p>\n<p>• Parry: If an attack is parried it is negated entirely.</p>\n<p>• Block: If an attack is blocked, roll the damage of the attack. If the damage exceeds the shield’s Block Rating against that damage type, then the character takes the full damage to their shield arm. Otherwise no damage is taken. Magic damage treats BR as half (round up) unless there is a magic BR.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>\_</p>"
