      content: "<p>Damage represents the ability of an attack to harm a character. Attacks against a character always strike a particular hit location (determined by the 1s digit of the attack roll, or a d10 counting 10 as 0), and the damage of that attack is reduced by the Armor Rating (AR) of that hit location. The characters Hit Points (HP) are then reduced by the remaining amount.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1549%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:32.4902%\"><strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_Result</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:66.7995%\"><strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ Location Hit</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:32.4902%\">1-5</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.7995%\">Body</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:32.4902%\">6</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.7995%\">Right Leg</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:32.4902%\">7</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.7995%\">Left Leg</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:32.4902%\">8</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.7995%\">Right Arm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:32.4902%\">9</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.7995%\">Left Arm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:32.4902%\">0</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.7995%\">Head</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><strong>Damage Types</strong></p>\n<p>The above rules hold true for all physical attacks and physical armor.
