        <p>Mounted combat functions like normal combat, but with a few key
        differences:</p>

        <p>• Mounted characters can evade ranged attacks but only while moving.
        They cannot evade melee attacks (except those from other mounted
        characters), though their mount can.</p>

        <p>• Mounted characters may parry or counter attack in response to
        attacks against their mount.</p>

        <p>• Mounted characters use their mount’s Speed.</p>

        <p>• The GM may rule that ranged attacks that miss the character or
        their mount hit the other target instead.</p>
