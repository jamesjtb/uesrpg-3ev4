If they fail, they suffer a -20 penalty to all combat tests as they become entangled. They can use an action to repeat the test and free themselves on success.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>If this effect was applied by a melee attack, then if the target character leaves the melee ranged of the Entangling weapon then the character wielding the weapon must choose to either let go of their weapon (maintaining the effect on the target), or keep their weapon (removing the effect from the target).\_</p>"
