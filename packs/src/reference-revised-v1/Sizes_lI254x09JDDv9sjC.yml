      content: "<p>Tamriel is home to creatures of many shapes and sizes. A character’s size affects them in a number of critical ways. There are seven different size categories.</p>\n<p>• Puny: This category is reserved for the smallest of creatures like kwama foragers, rats, or mice.</p>\n<p>• Tiny: This category includes smaller characters like cats or large cave rats.</p>\n<p>• Small: This category includes everything ranging from quadrupeds like wolves to smaller bipeds like goblins.</p>\n<p>• Standard: Standard sized characters fall fairly close to the average size for man or mer. There are no effects associated with this category.</p>\n<p>• Large: This category includes characters that are substantially larger than average, including quadrupeds like horses and larger bipeds like trolls.</p>\n<p>• Huge: This category includes very large characters such as giants or larger dwemer constructs.</p>\n<p>• Enormous: This category is reserved for extremely large characters, like dragons.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1549%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:35.0691%\"><strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ Size</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:64.2206%\"><strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ Combat Effects</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:35.0691%\">Puny</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.2206%\">-30 to hit by characters of larger size / at range</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:35.0691%\">Tiny</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.2206%\">-20 to hit by characters of larger size / at range</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:35.0691%\">Small</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.2206%\">-10 to hit at range</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:35.0691%\">Standard</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.2206%\">-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:35.0691%\">Large</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.2206%\">+10 to hit at range</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:35.0691%\">Huge</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.2206%\">+20 to hit by characters of smaller size / at range</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:35.0691%\">Enormous</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.2206%\">+30 to hit by characters of small size / at range</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
