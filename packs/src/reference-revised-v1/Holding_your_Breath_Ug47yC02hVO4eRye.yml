This duration is doubled if the character does nothing but hold their breath (no action or movement allowed).</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>For every round beyond the characterâ€™s Endurance Bonus holding their breath, the character gains a temporary level of fatigue until they die or regains access to fresh air, after which the temporary fatigue is removed at a rate of 1 per round.</p>"
