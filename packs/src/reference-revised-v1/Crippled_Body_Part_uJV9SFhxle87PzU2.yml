        <p>A piece of the characterâ€™s body has been rendered temporarily
        useless. Multiple instances of this condition can affect a character at
        once as long as each affects a different hit location and/or the body
        parts associated with that hit location. Any body part that has been
        crippled suffers all the same penalties as if it had been lost, using
        lost eye if the head location has been crippled, and the organ damage
        condition if the body location has been crippled.</p>
