  description: >-
    <p>The character can utilize his voice in subtle ways to affect the world
    around him. By making a simple +0 Thu&rsquo;um test, the Tongue can affect
    something that he can see within his Willpower Bonus in meters with any
    effect that could be caused by one of the words he knows, like igniting
    something easily flammable by using the word for fire, Yol, or cause
    something small to move by using the word for force, Fus.</p>

    <p>What the tongue can and cannot do with this talent is up to the GM, but
    the effect is generally small and innocuous, though it is still apparent to
    those nearby that the Tongue is using his Voice.</p>
