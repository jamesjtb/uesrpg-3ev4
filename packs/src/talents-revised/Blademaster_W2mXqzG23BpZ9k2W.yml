  description: >-
    <p>The character knows how to leverage his strength with a longsword, using
    the hilt of his weapon or a well placed thrust to overcome his foe&rsquo;s
    armor. When making Combat Style (Strength) tests to wield a longsword in two
    hands the character may choose to replace the
    @Compendium[uesrpg-revision.journal.8QrUeG8YXaLx1BqW]{Slashing} quality with
    @Compendium[uesrpg-revision.journal.mnfUeIEQkOInlwPK]{Crushing} (1).</p>

    <p>The character also knows that speed often triumphs over strength, and can
    take maximum advantage of quick precise blows to bring down an opponent.
    When making Combat Style (Agility) tests to wield a longsword in two hands
    the character may choose to use his Agility bonus in place of his Strength
    bonus for the purposes of the Slashing quality.</p>

    <p>Additionally, when the character takes a Defensive Stance action while
    holding a longsword in two hands they gain a +10 to the next parry or
    counter attack made before their next turn.</p>
