  description: >-
    <p>This character has unlocked the secrets of starlight, and with the right
    materials and timing, restore power to Welkynd and Varla stones, and even
    create new ones. The character learns the Siphon Starlight and Create Ayleid
    Stone rituals.</p>

    <h2>Create Ayleid Stone</h2>

    <p>The character has uncovered the secret of making Welkynd and Varla
    stones.</p>

    <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Welkynd
    Stones</strong></span></h3>

    <p>To create a Welkynd stone, the character must accrue aproximately 150
    drakes worth of materials, not uncluding some kind of valuable
    gemstone(Anything except diamonds may be used) Then the character may make a
    -10 Blacksmithing test followed by a -10 Enchanting test to create the
    stone. Depending on the gemstone used to make the Welkynd stone, activating
    it may have seperate added on effects, that last until their next long rest
    such as:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Amethyst- Character gains Resistance(Magic, 2)</li>

    <li>Emerald- Character increases their SP max by 1.</li>

    <li>Garnet- Character increases their Wound Threshold by 1.</li>

    <li>Ruby- Character increases their max HP by 3.</li>

    <li>Saphhire- Character gains Power Well(25).</li>

    </ul>

    <p>If any of these gemstones happen to be flawless, both of the tests made
    to create the stone become -30, and the effects of each stone are
    doubled.</p>

    <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Varla
    Stones</strong></span></h3>

    <p>To create a Varla stone, the character must accrue aproximately 250
    drakes worth of materials, not uncluding a diamond gemstone. Then the
    character may make a -20 Blacksmithing test followed by a -20 Enchanting
    test to create the stone. Once created this stone functions the same as any
    other Varla stone, but allows for the full recharging of 3 different
    enchanted items.</p>

    <p>If the Diamond happens to be flawless, both of the tests made to create
    the Varla stone become -40, and it may be used to fully recharge 6 different
    enchanted items.</p>

    <h2>Siphon Starlight</h2>

    <p>Using this ritual, the character can take power from the stars to power
    up the Welkynd and Varla stones that they have created or ones that have no
    charge left in them. After making a Lore -20 test and preparing a ritual
    outside underneath the stars, the character may place the stone in the
    middle of ritually prepared area. They must then leave it there undisturbed
    overnight. In the morning the stone will be charged, and function normally.
    This ritual costs approximiately 100 drakes of materials.</p>
