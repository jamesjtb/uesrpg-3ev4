    <p><span style="color: #191813;">As part of a melee attack, this character
    can slam a 4m line originating from themselves. Any target that is hit is
    thrown vertically a number of meters equal to the damage they receive. They
    then suffer the consequences of falling as usual. This attack is resolved as
    an AOE.</span></p>
