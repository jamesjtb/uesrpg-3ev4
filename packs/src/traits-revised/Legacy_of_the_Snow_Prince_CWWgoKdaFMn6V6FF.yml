  description: >-
    <p>Once per Long Rest, the Falmer can as a free action, summon a
    miniaturized blizzard on themselves, which counts as a level 3 Frost Cloak
    which lasts for three Rounds. Additionally, as a ritual that must be
    performed during a Long Rest, the Falmer can use 100 drakes worth of ritual
    materials, and spend 100 Magicka Points to invoke a blizzard in the
    immediate region, no matter the climate.</p>

    <p>The blizzard is magical in nature and imposes a -20 on any tests reliant
    on sight (including combat), and additionally counts as dangerous weather.
    Falmer are immune to all the effects of the blizzard, which lasts for [[/r
    1d12]] + PrsB hours, which should be rolled in secret by the GM.</p>
