  description: >-
    <p>Incorporeal characters are spirits, faintly visible and capable of moving
    through objects. They gain the Flyer (Speed) trait and may use it to freely
    move through solid objects. They can be targeted by attacks, but cannot
    suffer damage except for magic damage, or damage from attacks with the Magic
    quality. Incorporeal characters do not normally affect the world, but they
    can use magic and make attacks that are capable of damaging non-incorporeal
    beings. Attacks from Incorporeal characters ignore all AR from any armor
    that does not have the Magic quality, and cannot be blocked by shields
    without that quality.</p>
