    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 SP</p>

    <p>Upon taking damage, the Ogrim can negate all damage from the attack. If
    the attacking weapon has the
    @Compendium[uesrpg-revision.journal.Q8ED7VzyqBKpfxEo]{Impaling} quality, the
    damage is only halved instead. When a creature's melee attack is affected by
    this, they become
    @Compendium[uesrpg-revision.journal.JRXHJW251nVbRubN]{Dazed} for one round
    as they stagger back. If the weapon has the Impaling quality, the wielder
    must immediately pass a +30 Luck test or else the weapon is stuck in the
    Ogrim's rolling mounds of fat, and the character is disarmed. Retrieving the
    stuck weapon requires a Take Weapon special action that the Ogrim does not
    oppose, but the character must still succeed on their Unarmed or Athletics
    test.</p>
