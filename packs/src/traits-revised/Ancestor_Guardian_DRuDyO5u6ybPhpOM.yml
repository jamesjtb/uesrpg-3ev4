  description: >-
    <p>The Dunmer can, once per Long Rest, cast Sanctuary (3) on themselves that
    lasts for 3 Rounds as a free action that costs no Magicka Points, and
    requires no test. Additionally, the Dunmer can perform a ritual that costs
    10 drakes worth of incense and powders during a Long Rest to consult with
    their ancestor, asking up to d4+1 questions. The ancestor replies only with
    a disembodied voice only the Dunmer can hear, or sends imagery or signs to
    be interpreted. This is up to GM&rsquo;s arbitration. The ancestor can only
    share knowledge and wisdom it would reasonably have had while they were
    alive.</p>
