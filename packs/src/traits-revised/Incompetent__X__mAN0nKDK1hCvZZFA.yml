  description: >-
    <p>The character is particularly bad at something. Pick a skill that the
    character possesses, and choose something related to that skill the
    character would be considered incompetent in, just like you would choose a
    specialty. It must be something general enough that the character could
    conceivably be forced to roll at some point and must be a skill that the
    character has trained to at least +0, like Swimming for Athletics (the GM is
    the final arbiter of what qualifies as such). Whenever the character is
    forced to make a roll with the chosen skill that would be affected by the
    chosen Incompetence, gain a -10 penalty to said roll per X.</p>

    <p>*Gain 100 CrP per level of X</p>
