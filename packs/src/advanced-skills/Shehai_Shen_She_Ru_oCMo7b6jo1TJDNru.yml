  description: >-
    <p>The Shehai Shen She Ru, or &ldquo;Way of the Spirit Sword,&rdquo; is the
    culmination of the art of sword-singing, practiced by ancient Redguards in
    Yokuda known as sword-singers. The greatest of the sword-singers were known
    as Ansei, or &ldquo;Saints of the Sword.&rdquo; The core of the Shehai Shen
    She Ru is a simple devotion to swordsmanship. This is how every sword singer
    begins his journey: through intense study, and eventual mastery, of the art
    of the blade.</p>

    <p>Characters can utilize the Shehai Shen She Ru skill (with either Strength
    or Agility) as if it were the Combat Style [Field] skill whenever wielding
    any type of sword (larger or smaller weapons, such as daggers and
    greatswords, also count).</p>
