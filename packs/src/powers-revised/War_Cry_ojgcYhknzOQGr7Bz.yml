  description: >-
    <p>The character is able to call on a very simple form of the Thu&rsquo;um
    and harness it to frighten their enemies in battle. As free action, they can
    issue a mighty war cry that forces all enemies who hear it to make a Panic
    (+20) test. If a character passes this test, they are immune to the effects
    of this power for the remainder of the encounter. This power may only be
    used once until after the character&rsquo;s next long rest.</p>
