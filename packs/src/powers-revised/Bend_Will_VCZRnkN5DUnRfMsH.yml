    <p><em>Difficulty: -20, -10 for each word beyond the first.</em></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Gol : Earth</strong></p>

    <p>Character may issue a simple command to the earth itself. There is no
    real limit to what can be done with this Shout, but the GM should be careful
    about what he allows. Some examples: Commanding a dense forest to open a
    clear path, ordering the very dust of the earth to take flight as a cloud to
    obscure vision, or splitting very thick ice to allow passage.</p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Hah : Mind</strong></p>

    <p>Character may issue a simple command not only to the earth (as with Gol)
    but to other beings. Any non-Dragon being who hears the shout must make a
    Willpower test. Failure means they must obey the stated command to the best
    of their abilities.</p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Dov : Dragon</strong></p>

    <p>Same effects as Hah, except the Willpower Test is made at a -20 modifier
    and Dragons may now be affected.</p>
