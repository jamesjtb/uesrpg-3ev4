    <p><strong>Type</strong>: Active (Primary Action)</p>

    <p><strong>Requires</strong>: Shehai Shen She Ru (Master)</p>

    <p><strong>Cost</strong>: 300 XP</p>

    <p><strong>Difficulty</strong>: -40</p>

    <p><strong>Effect</strong>: Before the technique test, character chooses a
    target within a number of meters equal to twice their Willpower bonus. The
    swordsinger may immediately make a standard melee attack against that target
    as a free action (even if they are not engaged in melee). The attack may not
    be defended against, and no characters can make any other type of reaction
    to this attack.</p>

    <p>If the initial attack is successful, the character may make another free
    attack with the same conditions, although this attack cannot gain advantages
    and is made at a -20 penalty. These bonus attacks can be repeated (each
    successful one prompting another) up to a maximum number of bonus attacks
    equal to the swordsinger&rsquo;s Willpower bonus. Each attack receives an
    additional, stacking -20 penalty (-20, then -40, then -60, and so forth).
    None of these attacks, including the first, can win Advantage. These bonus
    attacks do not count against the maximum attacks per round.</p>
