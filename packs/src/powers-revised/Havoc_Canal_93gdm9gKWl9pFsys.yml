    <p><strong>Type:</strong> Active (activated as a Free Action)</p>

    <p><strong>Requires:</strong> Shehai Shen She Ru (Journeyman)</p>

    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 150 XP</p>

    <p><strong>Difficulty: </strong>-20</p>

    <p><strong>Effect:</strong> This technique is activated as a free action,
    but only before a melee attack. On the character&rsquo;s next successful
    standard melee attack this turn he chooses a hit location. The attack is
    resolved against the chosen hit location regardless of its original hit
    location. If the attack test succeeds with more than five degrees of
    success, the character can immediately make another standard melee attack as
    a free action, which is automatically resolved against the chosen hit
    location. This second attack cannot be defended against but cannot gain
    advantages. These attacks are resolved simultaneously, so any advantages
    from the initial attack do not apply when resolving the bonus attack. This
    bonus attack does not count against the usual limit of attacks per
    round.</p>
