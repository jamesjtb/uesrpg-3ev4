    <p><strong>Type: </strong>Active (Primary Action)</p>

    <p><strong>Requires:</strong> Shehai Shen She Ru (Adept)</p>

    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 300 XP</p>

    <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> -30</p>

    <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Before the technique test, character chooses a
    target within melee range. On success the character may immediately make a
    standard melee attack against that opponent as a free action, using the
    results of his technique test in place of his attack test. For the purpose
    of this attack, the target cannot react in any way, and does not benefit
    from any Armour, Natural Toughness, or Resistances, in addition to the
    attack having the Magic quality.</p>
