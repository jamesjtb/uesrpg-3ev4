  description: >-
    <p>This character can speak the word of the divines for an hour in order to
    remove a single wound and all of its effects (not including lost limbs) from
    another character.</p>

    <p>This also restores an amount of HP equal to the damage dealt to cause the
    wound. The character may choose to burn [[/r 2d6]] Luck in order to allow
    this power to also restore lost limbs. The target character must remain
    still for the entire duration while the character performs the ritual. This
    power can only be used once until the character&rsquo;s next long rest.</p>
