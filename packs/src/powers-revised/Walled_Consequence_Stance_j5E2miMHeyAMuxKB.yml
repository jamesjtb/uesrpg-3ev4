    <p><strong>Type</strong>: Active (Secondary Action, activated as a
    reaction)</p>

    <p><strong>Requires</strong>: Shehai Shen She Ru (Expert)</p>

    <p><strong>Cost</strong>: 200 XP</p>

    <p><strong>Difficulty</strong>: -20</p>

    <p><strong>Effect</strong>: This technique may be activated as a reaction to
    another character&rsquo;s use of a Shehai technique directed at the
    character. On success, the character may attempt a defensive reaction for
    free against an attack that would otherwise be impossible to defend against
    as a result of that technique. If the opponent&rsquo;s Shehai Shen She Ru
    technique allows them to make multiple attacks, the swordsinger can make a
    defensive reaction to each of them for free. Additionally, every successful
    defensive reaction made against an enemy Shehai user&rsquo;s techniques
    forces the attacker to immediately lose one Stamina Point.</p>
