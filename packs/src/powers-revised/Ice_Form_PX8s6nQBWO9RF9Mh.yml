    <p><em>Difficulty: -10, -10 for each word beyond the first.</em></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Liz : Ice</strong></p>

    <p>Character encases all targets within a 15 degree cone with a twenty meter
    range in a thin layer of ice. These targets must roll a -10 Strength Check
    or count as having the
    @Compendium[uesrpg-revision.journal.ssFkdtMuSNHD6zvh]{Stunned} condition for
    the next two rounds, though effects that would allow them to resist or
    ignore stuns do not apply here. Counts as a ranged, area of effect attack
    for the purposes of evasion.</p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Slen : Flesh</strong></p>

    <p>Same as Liz, except the Strength Test becomes -20, and the character may
    choose to double the duration, area, or range.</p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Nus : Statue</strong></p>

    <p>Same as Slen, except the effect is now irresistible, and the character
    may choose to double the duration, area, or range again (double two or
    quadruple one).</p>
