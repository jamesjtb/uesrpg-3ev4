    <p><em>Difficulty: -20, -10 for each word beyond the first.</em></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Ven : Wind</strong></p>

    <p>Creates a whirling cyclone centered on the character. Characters who come
    within twenty five meters of the character must make a Strength test each
    round they remain within range. Those that fail the test are knocked to the
    ground. The cyclone persists for five rounds.</p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Gaar : Unleash</strong></p>

    <p>Same as Ven, except the cyclone picks up enough debris that it causes
    [[/r 2d6]] damage with the
    @Compendium[uesrpg-revision.journal.mnfUeIEQkOInlwPK]{Crushing} (WpB)
    quality to all characters within range each round. The Strength test is made
    at a -10 modifier. The radius increases to thirty five meters.</p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Nos : Strike</strong></p>

    <p>Same as Gaar, except the radius of the Cyclone is increased to fifty
    meters, and the Cyclone deals [[/r 4d6]] damage with the
    @Compendium[uesrpg-revision.journal.mnfUeIEQkOInlwPK]{Crushing} (WpB)
    quality instead. The Strength test is made at a -20 modifier instead.</p>
