    <p><em>Difficulty: -30, -10 for each word beyond the first.</em></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Rii : Essence</strong></p>

    <p>Target being within twenty five meters of the character must make an
    Opposed Willpower test against the character. If the target fails, they
    die.</p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Vaaz : Tear</strong></p>

    <p>Same as Rii, except if the target fails, their corpse rises to fight for
    the character for five Rounds. It uses their character profile.</p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Zol : Zombie</strong></p>

    <p>Same as Vaaz, except the target gains the counts as being affected by the
    Soul Trap spell before death, and the character may choose which soul gem to
    bind them to.</p>
