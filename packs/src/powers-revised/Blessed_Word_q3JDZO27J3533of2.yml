    <p>The character may begin speaking the word of the divines through the use
    of the Cast Magic action. This creates a circle with a radius equal to their
    Willpower bonus in meters. Characters with the Undead or Undying traits must
    flee the circle and no characters with those traits may willingly enter it
    unless they can pass a -40 Willpower test (which may be attempted once per
    round).</p>
