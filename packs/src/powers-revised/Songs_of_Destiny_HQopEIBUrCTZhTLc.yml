    <p><em><strong>Thu&rsquo;um Chant: </strong>This Shout is unique. It uses
    the same testing functions of normal Shouts, but costs triple the usual
    Stamina Points. Additionally, the Shout is a literal song that must be
    repeated and continuously sung to keep reality bent to the Tongue&rsquo;s
    will. While a character is benefitting from the Songs of Destiny Shout, they
    cannot use any other Shouts or speak normally. If the character stops
    singing the Song for any reason, its effects end.</em></p>

    <p><em>Difficulty: -20, -20 for each word beyond the first.</em></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Prodah : Unavoidable Fate</strong></p>

    <p>The character must state an event that must come true, like &ldquo;Today,
    we will taste victory against the Dunmeri!&rdquo; and then roll the
    Thu&rsquo;um test. Success means that all who would oppose this destiny
    within the Tongue&rsquo;s Willpower in meters gains a -10 penalty to all
    tests, and likewise would all those who seek to fulfill this destiny gain a
    +10 bonus to all tests. This includes actions that would enter the
    Tongue&rsquo;s sphere of influence, like an archer attempting to shoot at
    the tongue whilst being out reach.</p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Daan : Prophesy</strong></p>

    <p>As Prodah, except the penalty and bonus both become 20, and those within
    the sphere of influence who seek to oppose it treat any roll they make
    resulting in a number equal to the one of the character&rsquo;s Lucky
    Numbers as having Critically</p>

    <p>Failed. Likewise, anyone seeking to further the chosen fate treats any
    roll resulting in a number equal to the character&rsquo;s Lucky Numbers as
    a</p>

    <p>Critical Success.</p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Miiraad : Choice</strong></p>

    <p>As Daan, except the penalty and bonus both become 30 instead.
    Additionally, anyone resisting the chosen fate also treat any roll equal to
    the Tongue&rsquo;s Unlucky Numbers as having critically failed, and any
    aiding it counting rolls of the Tongue&rsquo;s Unlucky Numbers as a Critical
    Success.</p>

    <p>Lastly, the Tongue&rsquo;s grasp on destiny becomes so strong that any
    opposing the chosen fate lose the ability to Burn Luck for any reason except
    to survive, and any aiding it reduces any amount of Luck burnt by 1, to a
    minimum of 1.</p>
