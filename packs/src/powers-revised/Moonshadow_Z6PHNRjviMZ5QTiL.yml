  description: >-
    <p>The character possesses a simple form of innate shadow magic. This power
    may be activated once a day with the use of the Cast Magic action.</p>

    <p>The character becomes
    @Compendium[uesrpg-revision.journal.ShazAWRXSiPT6Gwf]{Invisible} for 18
    seconds (3 rounds). The character may spend a Luck point, or burn one Luck,
    to extend this duration by one round (this may be done as many times as the
    character desires). This power may only be used once until after the
    character&rsquo;s next long rest. The effect is broken if they make an
    attack, but reactivates at the beginning of their next round as long as they
    still have time left.</p>
