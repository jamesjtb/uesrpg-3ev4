    <p><strong>Type:</strong> Active (activated as a Free Action)</p>

    <p><strong>Requires:</strong> Shehai Shen She Ru (Apprentice)</p>

    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 150 XP</p>

    <p><strong>Difficulty: </strong>+0, with a -10 imposed for each activation
    of this ability beyond the first per Rest.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect:</strong> The character can activate this technique after
    being successfully attacked by a melee, ranged, or bolt-style spell attack.
    Activating this technique is free, and can be done before the character
    declares a defensive reaction. The character can immediately make a Shehai
    Shen She Ru test with the appropriate difficulty. If successful, the
    character reduces the DoS of the attacker&rsquo;s attack roll by the DoS on
    the Shehai Shen She Ru test. If the attacker&rsquo;s DoS are reduced to 0 or
    less, they count as having failed their attack. The character can then
    choose to declare a defensive reaction if they wish, as normal.</p>
