    <p><em>Difficulty: +10, -10 for each word beyond the first.</em></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Fiik : Mirror</strong></p>

    <p>Creates an incorporeal, but seemingly normal, decoy of the character at
    target location within twenty five meters of the character. The double
    mirrors his exact movements and persists for 1 minute.</p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Lo : Deceive</strong></p>

    <p>Same as Fiik, except the character may either double the range or the
    duration.</p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Sah : Phantom</strong></p>

    <p>Same as Lo, except the character may control the decoy with his mind (he
    doesn&rsquo;t need to move) and it may also speak with his voice (it cannot
    use shouts, however).</p>
