    <p><strong>Type:</strong> Passive (activated as a Free Action)</p>

    <p><strong>Requires:</strong> Shehai Shen She Ru (Adept)</p>

    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 200 XP</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>This technique must be activated at the
    beginning of a round, and its effect remains until the end of that round.
    Other characters must pass a Perception or Observe test with a -20 penalty
    before being allowed make attacks or reactions against the sword-singer each
    time they wish to do so. The sword-singer then loses a Stamina Point when
    the effect ends.</p>
