    <p><em>Difficulty: -30, -10 for each word beyond the first.</em></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Gol : Earth</strong></p>

    <p>A number of targets up to the character&rsquo;s WpB is healed [[/r 1d6]]
    hp as dirt springs from the ground and covers up any injuries.</p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Gron : Bond</strong></p>

    <p>Same as Gol, except the character can choose to either increase the
    healing to [[/r 2d6]], or double the number of targets, but anyone healed in
    this fashion reduces their speed by 3 for the next 24 hours as the weight of
    the dirt weighs the target down as it slowly heals the flesh. In addition,
    the shout removes any non-permanent shock effects from wounds taken.</p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Aav : Unity</strong></p>

    <p>Same as Gron, except the character can choose to add an additional die to
    the amount healed, or double the number of targets again. Additionally, the
    shout can be used to remove permanent wound effects from wounds taken (even
    in prior battles), but the new earthen body-parts comes with a cost in the
    form one or more of the conditions listed below:</p>

    <p>&bull; Earthen Ears: The character removes the Lost</p>

    <p>Ear condition, and the Deafened condition, but</p>

    <p>loses 5 Perception as all sounds are distant and</p>

    <p>muffled to the character.</p>

    <p><em><strong>&bull; Earthen Eyes:</strong></em> The character removes the
    Lost Eye condition, and the Blinded condition, but loses 5 Perception as the
    strange blurry vision is never quite in focus.</p>

    <p><em><strong>&bull; Earthen Foot/Leg:</strong></em> The character removes
    the Lost Foot/Leg condition, and the Immobilized condition if both were
    lost, but retain the Slowed Condition as the replacement seems firmly
    attached to the ground.</p>

    <p><em><strong>&bull; Earthen Hand/Arm:</strong></em> The character removes
    the Lost Hand/Arm condition but suffers a -5 Strength as it is slightly numb
    and slow.</p>

    <p><em><strong>&bull; Earthen Entrails:</strong></em> The character removes
    the Organ Damage condition, but must choose whether his SP maximum or WT
    stays reduced by 1 as no matter how well it functions, the body just never
    fully recovers.</p>
