  description: >-
    <p>The character is exceptionally average looking, which for better or
    worse, makes him harder to remember and recognize. Whenever this character
    attempts to blend in with a crowd he gains a +10 to all Subterfuge and
    Stealth tests made to fit in.</p>

    <p>When appropriate at the GM&rsquo;s discretion, any NPC trying to remember
    or describe the character will either have trouble doing so, such as wrongly
    describing him, or simply be unable to remember him at all.</p>
