  description: >-
    <p>The character is addicted to some substance, such as alcohol, moonsugar,
    skooma, or even more alien or outlandish drugs such as feldew. Should the
    character not be able to indulge in the drug regularly (more accessible
    drugs require more frequent access), they suffer a -10 penalty on all tests,
    which increases in severity by an additional -10 to a maximum of -30 for
    each passing day until they get their fix.</p>
