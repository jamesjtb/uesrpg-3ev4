  description: >-
    <p>The witch-men of the reach are blessed by the Old Gods with a righteous
    fury towards any and all invaders, and will not helm until every last one of
    them are dead at their feet. Any social interaction test except Intimidation
    with people not sympathetic with the Reachmen suffers a -10 penalty as they
    are surrounded by rumors and superstitions. However, the Reachmen gain a +10
    bonus to all Combat Style tests made while in Frenzy or using the All- Out
    Attack action as they fight with the fervor of the Old Gods themselves.</p>
