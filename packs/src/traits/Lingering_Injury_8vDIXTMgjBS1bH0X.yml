  description: >-
    <p>The character has an old injury that comes back to bug them at the worst
    times. The GM and the player should work out the specifics of the injury,
    and how it affects the character. However, living with a painful injury has
    made the character tough, granting 1 Stamina Point to the character as
    powering through exhaustion and pain is everyday life for the character.</p>
