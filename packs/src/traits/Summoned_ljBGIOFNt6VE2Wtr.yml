  description: >-
    <p>The character has been summoned into this world through magic. They must
    obey the verbal commands of their master, who summoned them. If their master
    is killed, they are banished back to their realm instantly.</p>

    <p>Summoned characters cannot attack their masters unless it is to defend
    themselves. If this character is killed, they do not die in the conventional
    sense: instead they are banished back to their realm of origin, along with
    any items that may be on them at the time.</p>
