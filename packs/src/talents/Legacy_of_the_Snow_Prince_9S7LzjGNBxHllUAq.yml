  description: >-
    <p>Once per Long Rest, the Falmer can spend a Stamina Point as a free action
    to summon a miniaturized blizzard on themselves, which counts as a level 3
    Frost Cloak that lasts for three Rounds. Additionally, as a ritual that must
    be performed during a Long Rest, the Falmer can use 100 drakes worth of
    ritual materials, and spend 100 Magicka Points to invoke a blizzard in the
    immediate region, no matter the climate. The blizzard is magical in nature
    and imposes a -20 on any tests reliant on sight (including combat). Falmer
    are immune to all the effects of the blizzard, which lasts for 1d12 +
    Personality Bonus hours, which should be rolled in secret by the GM.</p>
