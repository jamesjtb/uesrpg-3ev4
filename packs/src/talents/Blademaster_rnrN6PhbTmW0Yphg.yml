  description: >-
    <p>The character knows how to leverage their strength with a longsword using
    the hilt of their weapon or a well placed thrust to overcome their foeâ€™s
    armor. When making Combat Style (Strength) tests to wield a longsword in two
    hands the character may choose to replace the Slashing quality with Crushing
    (1). </p><p>The character also knows that speed often triumphs over
    strength, and can take maximum advantage of quick precise blows to bring
    down an opponent. When making Combat Style (Agility) tests to wield a
    longsword in two hands the character may choose to use their Agility bonus
    in place of their Strength bonus for the purposes of the Slashing
    quality.</p><p>Additionally, when the character takes a Defensive Stance
    action while holding a longsword in two hands they gain an additional +10 to
    the next parry made before their next turn.</p>
