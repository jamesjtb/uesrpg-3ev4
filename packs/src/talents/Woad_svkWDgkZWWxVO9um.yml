  description: >-
    <p>The Nord can, as an action, apply a smear of ritually prepared Woad war
    paint, which grants a Physical and Magical shield that protects against 5
    points of damage for 3 Rounds that refreshes for free each Round. If the
    shield has at least one hit point of damage remaining after the third Round,
    the shield continues to refresh until it is reduced to 0 shield HP, or until
    1 minute passes. This shield is semi-divine in nature and cannot be
    conventionally dispelled.</p>

    <p>The ritual necessary to prepare one dose of Woad paint requires the Nord
    have access to natural plants, an open sky, and must be performed over a
    Long Rest as they beseech Kyne for her blessings and protection in the
    battles to come.</p>
