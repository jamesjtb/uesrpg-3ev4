  description: >-
    <p>When a character throws a Javelin and successfully causes damage to the
    target (after mitigation), the target location (either a limb or the body)
    is Speared. A Speared hit location is treated as crippled until the Javelin
    is removed, either as a Free action inflicting the Bleeding(1) condition or
    as a Secondary action requiring a strength test, which if successful removes
    the spear without causing further harm.  </p><p>If the Javelin is blocked
    instead, the shield is Speared. A speared shield requires the wielder to
    spend one Stamina point in order to even attempt to block with the added
    weight of the javelin. Removing the javelin from the shield requires the
    character to succeed on a Strength test as a secondary action.</p>
