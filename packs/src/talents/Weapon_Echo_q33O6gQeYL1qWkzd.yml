  description: >-
    <p>When the character casts a Conjure Weapon spell, they may choose to
    reduce the duration of the spell to 1 round and allow the weapon to freely
    float above the ground in an unoccupied space they can see. When summoned in
    this way, the conjurer may make a single attack with the weapon on their
    turn (which still counts as one of the total number of attacks they can do
    each round) using Combat Style (Willpower) for its test. The first of these
    attacks can be made as a free action, but subsequent attacks with a weapon
    echo require 1 AP. Immediately before or after making this attack, the
    character can move the weapon their WB meters in any direction.</p>
