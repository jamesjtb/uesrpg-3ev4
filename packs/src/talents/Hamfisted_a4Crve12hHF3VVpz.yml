  description: >-
    <p><strong>(Lycanthrope, Wereboar, 2AP): </strong>This character can charge
    at their speed in any given direction. The Wereboar must be at least 5m from
    the target to initiate the charge. Upon colliding with the creature, the
    wereboar makes an attack roll with their natural weapon, and for every
    additional 1m they move beyond the required 5m, the charge does +1
    damage.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>If the charge attack hits, the target must make an Acrobatics test to
    stop from falling prone. The Wereboar can continue its charge with its
    remaining speed, but the bonus damage resets to zero. If the Wereboar
    collides with an obstacle, it will become stunned until the end of its next
    turn. If the charge is counterattacked, the Wereboar will lose its Natural
    Toughness for that attack.</p>
