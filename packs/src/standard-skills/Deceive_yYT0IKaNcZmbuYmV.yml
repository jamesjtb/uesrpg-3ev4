    <p><em>Example Specializations: Blathering, Impersonation</em></p>

    <p>Deceive measure&rsquo;s a character&rsquo;s aptitude for fooling others
    into believing something that is not true. A Deceive test should only be
    required if the character believes that they are lying. This test can be
    opposed by a Logic test or an Observe test, depending on the nature of the
    deception. Your GM may ask you to test Deceive when you try to accomplish
    tasks like the following...</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Pretend to be someone you are not</li>

    <li>Talk your way out of trouble</li>

    <li>Lie about something</li>

    <li>Pretend to be an expert on a subject</li>
