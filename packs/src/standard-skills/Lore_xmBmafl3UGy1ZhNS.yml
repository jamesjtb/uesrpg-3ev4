    <p>Lore represents a character&rsquo;s ability to recall information of all
    types. This includes any knowledge that they would possess due to their
    education or experience and is meant to represent a character&rsquo;s
    general knowledge. Specializations in this skill reflect a character&rsquo;s
    focus on one particular subject. Remember that &ldquo;general knowledge and
    education&rdquo; is a relative term: no matter how smart a character is,
    they shouldn&rsquo;t be able to roll to recall an obscure fact about unless
    they would have reasonably encountered the fact before.</p>

    <p>Your GM may ask you to test Lore when you try to accomplish tasks like
    the following...</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Remember specific details about something you learned</li>

    <li>Identify a creature that you have only read about</li>

    <li>Reconcile new information with what you already know</li>

    <li>Find similarities between two ancient legends</li>
