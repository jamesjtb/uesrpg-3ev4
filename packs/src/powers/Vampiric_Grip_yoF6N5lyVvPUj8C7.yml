  description: >-
    <p><strong>(Vampire Lord, Mindlock 1, 1 AP, 25 Magicka, Upkeep):
    </strong>While in Vampire Lord Form, the character can select a target
    within 20m to make a Willpower +20 test or be pulled within a 1m distance of
    the Vampire Lord and count as being Paralyzed (no Paralysis resistance
    applies here). The target takes 1d6 Magic damage and is suspended in the air
    as the Vampire Lord chokes them.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>At the beginning of the target's turn, they may take another Willpower
    +20 test to resist this effect. If they fail, they remain Paralyzed and take
    another 1d6 Magic damage.</p>

    <p>The Vampire Lord may choose to throw the target up to 10m away at any
    time for 1 AP to deal 1d10 damage to the target and any other targets they
    may collide with. This counts as a Ranged Attack.</p>
