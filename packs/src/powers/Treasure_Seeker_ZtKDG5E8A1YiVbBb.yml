  description: >-
    <p>The character has a knack for finding treasure, and overcoming the
    obstacles that protect it. At any time the character can choose to reroll a
    failed Subterfuge test made to pick a lock or disarm a trap, but only once
    for a given test. This power may only be used once until after the
    character&rsquo;s next long rest.</p>
