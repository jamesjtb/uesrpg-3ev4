  description: >-
    <p><strong>(Vampire, 1 AP): </strong>Target within 1m must make a Willpower
    +20 test or be Charmed by this character for 3 rounds when in combat.
    Outside of combat, this effect lasts for 3 hours. A Charmed character loses
    the will to fight. While charmed, the target becomes exceptionally docile
    towards the vampire. This ability can be used 1 time per Long Rest.</p>
