  description: >-
    <p>This character can speak the word of the divines for an hour in order to
    remove a single wound and all of its effects (not including lost limbs) from
    themselves. This also restores an amount of HP equal to the amount of damage
    dealt to cause the wound. The character may choose to burn 2d6 Luck in order
    to allow this power to also restore lost limbs. This power can only be used
    once until after the character&rsquo;s next long rest.</p>
