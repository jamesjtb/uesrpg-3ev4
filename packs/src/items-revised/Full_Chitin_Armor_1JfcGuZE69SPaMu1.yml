  description: >-
    <p><em>Chitin is a type of light plate armor which is constructed by
    laminating several layers of insect shell glued with organic resins. The
    design is superior to Western leather armor as it is lighter and more
    comfortable. It is easily found throughout Vvardenfell, but is most commonly
    favored by Ashlander tribes. The book Ice and Chiton tells a story of its
    benefits.</em></p>

    <p><em>Chitin weapons are similarly created from the laminated shells of
    creatures to produce strong but flexible weapons, typically serrated to
    create a more damaging edge.</em></p>
