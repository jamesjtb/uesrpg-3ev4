  description: >-
    <blockquote>

    <p>Blue-aquamarine stones commonly found in ayleid cities, with meteoric
    iron bases. They sit on stands with two pincers holding them in the air for
    many to see, although they can be knocked down with bows or spells. They
    were the easiest of the Ayleid stones to create, and their ability to fully
    restore magicka almost instantly make them welcome additions to any
    wizard&rsquo;s arsenal. Their purpose is mysterious, but the consensus is
    they were used to power devices or rooms in Ayleid estates.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>A character can harness the power of a Welkynd Stone with great ease. By
    harnessing its power as a Use Item action, the character immediately drains
    the stone of its power and is restored to full Magicka points. The stone
    then crumbles away into a fine powder, which is a Pinch of Welkynd Stone
    Dust.</p>
