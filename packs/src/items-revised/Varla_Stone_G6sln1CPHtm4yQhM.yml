  description: >-
    <blockquote>

    <p>White, luminescent stones created from enchanted shards of meteoric
    glass. They are quite rare, even for ayleid ruins, as they have been mostly
    picked clean due to their powerful ability to recharge magic items.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>A character can harness the power of a Varla Stone with great ease. By
    harnessing its power as a Use Item action, the character immediately drains
    the stone of its power. Alternatively, Varla stones can be used like soul
    gems, storing up to a soul level of 1000. It is with this power that a varla
    stone can restore enchantments to their full EL. The stone then crumbles
    away into a fine powder, which is a Pinch of Varla Stone Dust.</p>
