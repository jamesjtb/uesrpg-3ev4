    <blockquote>

    <p>Very large in size, with a silvery, nearly pure white color, and a gleam
    unmatched by any treasure in Tamriel. Great Welkynd Stones are the true
    legacy of the Ayleids; serving as the main power source for their cities and
    serving as a great resource to any worthy mage. These stones harness the
    power of Magnus himself some scholars will say, as these, the greatest of
    the Ayleids&rsquo; star stones, owe their existence to the god of magic.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Great Welkynd Stones are an almost infinite power source, commonly used
    in large aylied fortresses and keeps. Welkynd stones can also serve another
    purpose however. They can function by using its own innate magical ability
    to cast a large healing spell over a wide radius. The character using the
    stone must make a restoration -10 roll to succeed, giving him and any allies
    within the 25m blast radius the full heal equivalent to a level 4 heal ally
    spell, if you fail, regain half the health. However, unlike normal Welkynd
    and Varla Stones, Great Welkynd Stones don&rsquo;t crumble upon use, only
    fading into nothingness.</p>
