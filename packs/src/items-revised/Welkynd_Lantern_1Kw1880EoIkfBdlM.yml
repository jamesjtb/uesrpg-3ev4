  description: >-
    <blockquote>

    <p>Utilizing a harvested and refined Welkynd crystal, a Welkynd lantern runs
    not on oil or candle, but by magicka. Easily used and operated, and
    requiring only a modest amount of magic, a Welkynd lantern can cast great
    light in a staggeringly large radius, or be used to quietly and dimly light
    an area. A Welkynd lantern is a light source that weighs 1 ENC. Suspending a
    floating Welkynd crystal within a ribbed, meteoriciron lantern frame, the
    lantern is baroque and surprisingly heavy. Because it is magical, it stays
    lit even while underwater, in Oblivion, or anywhere else that might prevent
    conventional fires from being lit, and also does not give off an odour,
    sound, or smoke.&nbsp;</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>As an action, a character can light a Welkynd lantern by touching it
    willfully. Doing so, they can expend up to 10 Magicka Points. Each point of
    magicka spent allows it to cast bright light for up to 10m &times; (magicka
    spent) for 4 hours. The character can touch the lamp willfully to extinguish
    it, but relighting it will cost the full MP cost again if they chose to do
    so. The Welkynd Lantern&rsquo;s light effect is treated as a level 3 spell
    for the purpose of being magically dispelled.</p>
