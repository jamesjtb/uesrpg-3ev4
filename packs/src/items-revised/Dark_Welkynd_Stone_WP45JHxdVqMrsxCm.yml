  description: >-
    <blockquote>

    <p>Small crystals of black-light, an inversion of their aqueous-blue
    cousins, Dark Welkynd Stones are imbued with sorcerous power, and are left
    suspended by magic to act as simple sentinels. With proper expertise,
    training, and magical prowess, these Dark Welkynd Stones can be subverted,
    stolen, and used for ones&rsquo; own purposes.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>A character with an inert Dark Welkynd Stone can power it with a
    successful -20 Mysticism test as an Action. While activated, the Dark
    Welkynd Stone will float about a metre off the ground, and can be moved by
    pushing or carrying it around. The character can then nominate either
    targets to be attacked, or targets to be ignored.</p>

    <p>The character can then cast a Destruction spell up to spell level 2 into
    the Dark Welkynd Stone, and the crystal &ldquo;learns&rdquo; this spell. It
    can only know one at a time.</p>

    <p>The Dark Welkynd Stone will, once per round, cast this spell as a Bolt at
    the nearest eligible target (always succeeds with 1 DoS) until the character
    passes a +20 Mysticism test as an Action to make it stop, or it runs out of
    Magicka. The character must manually charge it with their own Magicka as an
    Action, transferring as much of their own available Magicka into it as they
    wish as a +0 Mysticism test. The Dark Welkynd Stone holds up to 100
    Magicka.</p>
