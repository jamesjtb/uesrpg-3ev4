  description: >-
    <p><em>“The Thief is the last Guardian Constellation, and her Season is the
    darkest month of Evening Star. Her Charges are the Lover, the Shadow, and
    the Tower. Those born under the sign of the Thief are not typically thieves,
    though they take risks more often and only rarely come to harm. They will
    run out of luck eventually, however, and rarely live as long as those born
    under other signs.”</em></p><p><strong>Those born under the sign of the
    Star-Cursed Thief roll an extra lucky number that they never lose regardless
    of their Luck score.</strong></p><p><strong>Additionally, they replace their
    rolled luck score with 50, gain the power, and gain the
    @UUID[Compendium.uesrpg-3ev4.signs.Item.X1zpVl4qbhqm7oNI]{Running out of
    Luck} trait.</strong></p><p><strong>Characters cannot spend Luck to choose
    this birth-sign. Instead, it is available as a choice for any character who
    naturally rolled the Thief sign.</strong></p>
