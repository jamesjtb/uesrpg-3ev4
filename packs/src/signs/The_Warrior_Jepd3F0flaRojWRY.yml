    <p><em>“The Warrior is the first Guardian Constellation and he protects his
    charges during their Seasons. The Warrior’s own season is Last Seed when his
    Strength is needed for the harvest. His Charges are the Lady, the Steed, and
    the Lord. Those born under the sign of the Warrior are skilled with weapons
    of all kinds, but prone to short tempers.”</em></p><p><strong>Those born
    under the sign of the Warrior increase their SP maximum by 1.</strong></p>
