  description: >-
    <p>This character can speak the word of the divines for an hour in order to
    remove a single wound and all of its effects (not including lost limbs) from
    another character.</p><p>This also restores an amount of HP equal to the
    amount of damage dealt to cause the wound. This character may choose to burn
    2d6 Luck to allow this power to also restore lost limbs. The target
    character must remain still for the entire duration while the character
    performs the ritual. This power can only be used once until after the
    characterâ€™s next long rest.</p>
