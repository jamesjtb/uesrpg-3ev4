  description: >-
    <p>The character possesses a simple form of innate shadow magic. This power
    may be activated once a day with the use of the Cast Magic action.
    </p><p>The character becomes Invisible for 18 seconds (3 rounds). The
    character may spend a Luck point, or burn one Luck, to extend this duration
    by one round (this may be done as many times as the character desires). This
    invisibility is broken if the character makes an attack, after which it
    reforms at the beginning of the next round as long as there is 1 round of
    duration left. This power may only be used once until after the characterâ€™s
    next long rest.</p>
