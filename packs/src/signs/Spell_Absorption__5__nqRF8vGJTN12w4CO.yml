  description: >-
    <p>Characters with this trait absorb a portion of the magic directed at them
    to fuel their own magicka reserves. Whenever magic from another
    source/character affects them, roll a d10. If the value is less than or
    equal to 5, the magic has no effect on them; instead, they regain missing MP
    up to the cost of the magic. </p><p>If a character with this trait would be
    affected by the Reflect spell, then the effects of each should be resolved
    in the reverse order to which they were applied. </p><p>For example, if a
    character with this trait has the Reflect spell effect applied to them after
    this trait is applied, then when the character is affected by another spell
    effect they would resolve Reflect against that effect first, then Spell
    Aborption if the effect is not reflected.</p>
