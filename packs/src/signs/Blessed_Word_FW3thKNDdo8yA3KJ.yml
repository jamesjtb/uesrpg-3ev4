  description: >-
    <p>The character may begin speaking the word of the divines through the use
    of the Cast Magic action. This has the effect of creating a circle with a
    radius equal to their Willpower bonus in meters. Characters with the Undead
    or Undying traits must flee the circle and no characters with those traits
    may willingly enter it unless they can pass a -40 Willpower test (which may
    only be attempted once per round). </p><p>The circle follows the character,
    but it only remains as long as they continue to speak the words and take the
    Cast Magic action each turn. Blessed Word can be sustained for at most 1
    minute (10 rounds). This power can only be used once until after the
    characterâ€™s next long rest.</p>
