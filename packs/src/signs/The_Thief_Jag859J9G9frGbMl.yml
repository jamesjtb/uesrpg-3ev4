  description: >-
    <p><em>“The Thief is the last Guardian Constellation, and her Season is the
    darkest month of Evening Star. Her Charges are the Lover, the Shadow, and
    the Tower. Those born under the sign of the Thief are not typically thieves,
    though they take risks more often and only rarely come to harm. They will
    run out of luck eventually, however, and rarely live as long as those born
    under other signs.”</em></p><p><strong>Those born under the sign of the
    Thief roll an extra lucky number that they never lose regardless of their
    Luck score.</strong></p>
