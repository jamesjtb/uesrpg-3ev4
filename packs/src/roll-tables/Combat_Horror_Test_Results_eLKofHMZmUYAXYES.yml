  <p>When a character is confronted by an excessively frightening event or
  adversary, they must make a Fear Test. There are two types of fear tests:
  panic and horror tests. If the character fails the test, they succumb to the
  effects of fear.</p><p>Your GM may call on you to make a Panic Test when you
  are confronted by mundane shock or horror. This is represented by the Panic
  (+/- X) notation, which is simply a Willpower test with a +/- X
  modifier.</p><p>Your GM may call on you to make a Horror Test when you are
  confronted by supernatural terrors. This is represented by the Horror (+/- X)
  notation, which is simply a Willpower test with a +/- X modifier. In general,
  horror tests with any sort of penalty should be reserved for the most
  terrifying monsters and mind melting terrors.</p><h3>Fear Effects</h3><p>If in
  combat a character fails a fear test, they must immediately roll a d100 on the
  appropriate table on the next page. The effects listed are applied immediately
  to the character.</p><p>If in a non-combat situation the character fails a
  fear test, the character becomes unnerved and suffers a -20 penalty to any
  tests that requires concentration on their part. This penalty lasts while the
  character remains in the vicinity of the object of their
  fear.</p><p>Characters may be able to shake off some of the effects of fear
  after the initial shock has worn off. The table below will specify certain
  cases where a character can make a Willpower test when it is their next turn
  to “snap out” of their fear. “Snapping out” of the fear always happens at the
  end of their turn.</p><p>If this succeeds, then they regain their senses,
  shrug off the effects, and may act normally from then on. If they fail this
  test, the effect continues, and they may try again when it is their next
  turn.</p>

      Momentary Blackout: The character is so overcome with horror that their
      mind fails them for a few precious seconds in the face of this horror. The
      character drops to the ground unconscious for 1 round and has a -10
      penalty to all actions afterwards for the rest of the encounter.

      Uncontrollable Vomiting: The character’s own body reacts with a gut
      wrenching sound as the character’s innards empty themselves, and they
      start vomiting uncontrollably. The character bends over and vomits for 1
      round and is considered helpless during this time. Afterwards the
      character is still nauseous and loses 1 Stamina point immediately.

      Manic Terror: The Character’s mind cracks like a fragile glass sculpture,
      and they begin to laugh maniacally. Turning upon the closest nearby friend
      or foe they start attacking them with whatever weapon they have in their
      hands at the moment. The character can attempt to snap out of it at the
      start of their first turn each round or be knocked unconscious to stop
      their manic rampage. Afterwards the character loses 1d4 Stamina points
      immediately.

      Hopeless and Despairing: The character falls to the ground and cries out
      in despair and terror while shutting out all other sounds, babbling and
      mumbling to themselves for comfort for 1d6 rounds. When they regain their
      senses they immediately lose 1d4 Stamina.

      Scared to Death: The character is so immeasurably overcome with terror and
      horror that their heart stops beating; they must make an Endurance test or
      die on the spot. Should they succeed, they instead fall catatonic for 1d4
      hours as with Blackout.
