      Momentary Blackout: The character is so overcome with horror that their
      mind fails them for a few precious seconds in the face of this horror. The
      character drops to the ground unconscious for 1 round and has a -10
      penalty to all actions afterwards for the rest of the encounter.

      Uncontrollable Vomiting: The character’s own body reacts with a gut
      wrenching sound as the character’s innards empty themselves and they start
      vomiting uncontrollably. The character bends over and vomits for 1 round
      and is considered helpless during this time, afterwards the character is
      still nauseous and loses 1 Stamina point immediately

      Manic Terror: The Character’s mind cracks like a fragile glass sculpture
      and they begin to laugh maniacally. Turning upon the closest nearby friend
      or foe they start attacking them with whatever weapon they have in their
      hands at the moment. The character can attempt to snap out of it at the
      start of their first turn each round or be knocked unconscious to stop
      their manic rampage. Afterwards the character loses 1d4 Stamina points
      immediately

      Hopeless and Despairing: The character falls to the ground and cries out
      in despair and terror while shutting out all other sounds, babbling and
      mumbling to themselves for comfort for 1d6 rounds and when they regain
      their senses they immediately lose 1d4 Stamina.

      Blackout: The character’s Mind snaps like a twig, unable to truly process
      the horror of the situation and collapsing instead. The character goes
      catatonic for 1d4 hours and cannot be roused by normal means during this
      time.

      Mind Break: The character’s will bends as their mind shatters, they drop
      to the ground while stuttering and mumbling incomprehensibly for 1d6
      rounds, also the character’s mind is irrepressibly damaged and they lose
      either 1d8 Willpower or Personality (player’s choice) permanently from the
      harrowing experience. Afterwards for the rest of the encounter the
      character cannot attack or approach the source of horror.

      hours as with Blackout.
