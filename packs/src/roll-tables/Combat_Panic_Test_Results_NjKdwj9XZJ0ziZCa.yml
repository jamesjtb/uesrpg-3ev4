  <p>When a character is confronted by an excessively frightening event or
  adversary, they must make a Fear Test. There are two types of fear tests:
  panic and horror tests. If the character fails the test, they succumb to the
  effects of fear.</p><p>Your GM may call on you to make a Panic Test when you
  are confronted by mundane shock or horror. This is represented by the Panic
  (+/- X) notation, which is simply a Willpower test with a +/- X
  modifier.</p><p>Your GM may call on you to make a Horror Test when you are
  confronted by supernatural terrors. This is represented by the Horror (+/- X)
  notation, which is simply a Willpower test with a +/- X modifier. In general,
  horror tests with any sort of penalty should be reserved for the most
  terrifying monsters and mind melting terrors.</p><h3>Fear Effects</h3><p>If in
  combat a character fails a fear test, they must immediately roll a d100 on the
  appropriate table on the next page. The effects listed are applied immediately
  to the character.</p><p>If in a non-combat situation the character fails a
  fear test, the character becomes unnerved and suffers a -20 penalty to any
  tests that requires concentration on their part. This penalty lasts while the
  character remains in the vicinity of the object of their
  fear.</p><p>Characters may be able to shake off some of the effects of fear
  after the initial shock has worn off. The table below will specify certain
  cases where a character can make a Willpower test when it is their next turn
  to “snap out” of their fear. “Snapping out” of the fear always happens at the
  end of their turn.</p><p>If this succeeds, then they regain their senses,
  shrug off the effects, and may act normally from then on. If they fail this
  test, the effect continues, and they may try again when it is their next
  turn.</p>

      Startled: The character is startled by the source of panic. They jump in
      their boots and pause for a brief moment as they struggle to reassess the
      situation. They may not make any reactions until the beginning of their
      next turn.

      Spooked: The character gets the shakes from the source of their panic.
      Fretting, nervous, and full of doubt, they suffer a -10 penalty to all
      tests for the rest of the encounter unless they snap out of it.

      cannot willingly approach the object of their fear, and they suffer a –10
      penalty to all tests until the end of the encounter.

      Lost Composure: The character loses their nerve and freezes in place.
      Their will to act is decimated by the stress on their mind from the source
      of their Panic. The character may take no actions until they snap out of
      it. After snapping out of it, the character will make all tests at a –10
      penalty for the rest of the encounter.

      Running and Screaming: The character breaks down with fear and flees. They
      must immediately flee directly away from the source of their fear as fast
      as they can, which includes ditching equipment slowing them down. They
      must do everything in their power to accomplish this and is at a -20
      penalty to all tests. Once away from the danger, they must successfully
      snap out of it to regain control, or the encounter must end.
