      it. After snapping out of it, the character will make all tests at a –10
      penalty for the rest of the encounter.

      must immediately flee directly away from the source of their fear as fast

      penalty to all tests. Once away from the danger they must successfully
      snap out of it to regain control, or the encounter must end.
