  Diseases are contracted after a failed Endurance test after an
  encounter with a disease carrier. Diseases are contracted as stage
  one, but can progress to different stages. The farther along the
  stage of the Disease, the harder it is to cure and treat.

      Ataxia is a common and relatively mild disease found across the breadth of
      Tamriel. Its symptoms include general pain and soreness, muscle stiffness,
      and anemia. Victims of Ataxia are often pale, groggy, and irritable
      because of their symptoms. Some particularly devious bandits and
      trap-makers are known to spring vials or lace nails with the bodily fluids
      of dead animals that carry the disease.

      Brain Rot is a progressively worsening, mind affecting disease. It dampens
      the intelligence, intuition, and mental acuity of its victims. Eventually,
      Brain Rot destroys any semblance of sanity and of the self in its victims,
      leaving them to shuffle in a broken stupor until they are cured or die.

      Bone Break Fever is a particularly cruel disease. Carried primarily by
      rats and bears, the disease aggressively attacks the victim’s bones until
      they are vulnerable and prone to breakage. Untreated Bone Break Fever
      often results in crippled, or outright severed limbs because of the
      fragility it causes in its victims.

      A relatively minor, non life-threatening illness, Blood Lung causes
      bleeding cysts in the victim’s lungs. They are prone to rupture at
      inconvenient times or times of physical exertion. While Blood Lung is not
      severe, and will not typically worsen, it does open the door for other
      diseases to take root, and can also serve as a vector of infection for
      others via the coughed up blood.

      Black Heart Blight, despite being a member of the Blight family of
      diseases created by Dagoth Ur, is a both a blight and a common disease and
      is less severe than its cousins. After the ending of the Blight in 3E 427,
      Black Heart Blight survived after making the jump to undead. It is carried
      by zombies exclusively after the destruction of Dagoth Ur, but prior to
      his death it was also carried by the various blighted beasts or Corprus
      monsters of Morrowind. It is an acute disease that saps the victim’s
      vitality and endurance. This is the Common Disease version.

      The Chills are a punishing infection caused by contact with the undead. It
      affects the victim’s mind and motor skills equally, resulting in confused,
      inarticulate stupors. Its other symptoms include an overwhelming sensation
      of cold that is not affected by the warmth of any fire, nor the light of
      the sun. It has lead to the death of many an unfortunate adventurer, lost,
      alone, and cold in the crypts that dot Tamriel.
