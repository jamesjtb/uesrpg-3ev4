  Diseases are contracted after a failed Endurance test after an
  encounter with a disease carrier. Diseases are contracted as stage
  one, but can progress to different stages. The farther along the
  stage of the Disease, the harder it is to cure and treat.

      Ataxia is a common and relatively mild disease found across the breadth of
      Tamriel. Its symptoms include general pain and soreness, muscle stiffness,
      and anemia. Victims of Ataxia are often pale, groggy, and irritable
      because of their symptoms. Some particularly devious bandits and
      trap-makers are known to spring vials or lace nails with the bodily fluids
      of dead animals that carry the disease.

      Brain Rot is a progressively worsening, mind affecting disease. It dampens
      the intelligence, intuition, and mental acuity of its victims. Eventually,
      Brain Rot destroys any semblance of sanity and of the self in its victims,
      leaving them to shuffle in a broken stupor until they are cured or die.

      Bone Break Fever is a particularly cruel disease. Carried primarily by
      rats and bears, the disease aggressively attacks the victim’s bones until
      they are vulnerable and prone to breakage. Untreated Bone Break Fever
      often results in crippled, or outright severed limbs because of the
      fragility it causes in its victims.

      A relatively minor, non life-threatening illness, Blood Lung causes
      bleeding cysts in the victim’s lungs. They are prone to rupture at
      inconvenient times or times of physical exertion. While Blood Lung is not
      severe, and will not typically worsen, it does open the door for other
      diseases to take root, and can also serve as a vector of infection for
      others via the coughed up blood.

      Black Heart Blight, despite being a member of the Blight family of
      diseases created by Dagoth Ur, is a both a blight and a common disease and
      is less severe than its cousins. After the ending of the Blight in 3E 427,
      Black Heart Blight survived after making the jump to undead. It is carried
      by zombies exclusively after the destruction of Dagoth Ur, but prior to
      his death it was also carried by the various blighted beasts or Corprus
      monsters of Morrowind. It is an acute disease that saps the victim’s
      vitality and endurance. This is the Common Disease version.

      The Chills are a punishing infection caused by contact with the undead. It
      affects the victim’s mind and motor skills equally, resulting in confused,
      inarticulate stupors. Its other symptoms include an overwhelming sensation
      of cold that is not affected by the warmth of any fire, nor the light of
      the sun. It has lead to the death of many an unfortunate adventurer, lost,
      alone, and cold in the crypts that dot Tamriel.

      Collywobbles’ main symptoms are uncontrollable shaking and chronic ache.
      The constant minor shaking and spasming can become debilitating, and the
      strain of the shakes causes muscle soreness.

      Dampworm is a parasite that infests the victim’s musculature, slithering
      in between the tissue. It can be felt occasionally moving underneath the
      skin, which is a revolting and disturbing experience to say the least. Its
      symptoms include minor twitches and lapses in gross motor skill, as well
      as uncontrollable sweating

      A relatively obscure Disease, Frostlimb causes intense sensations of
      coldness within the victim’s arms and legs, especially their fingers. As a
      result, fine motor skills are punished greatly, and the effect of Frost
      damage is greatly magnified.

      Carried primarily by slaughterfish, Greenspore is a mind affecting fungus
      that causes irritability and mild dementia. The spores take root in the
      victim’s mind, but are easily treated in the early stages. Mature
      Greenspore can cause permanent brain damage.

      The Rattles is a mild disease of subtle nervous ticks. The Rattles cause
      light finger ticks and forgetfulness. Victims of the Rattles are reported
      as appearing restless to the point of irritation, though the sufferers of
      the disease aren’t aware of their ticks unless paying deliberate
      attention.

      A notorious and common illness, Red Fever often hits during late autumn,
      or through contact with wild wolves or dogs. The fever is short lived but
      intense, causing intense sweating, fever, vomiting, and often other
      unpleasant bodily functions. Red Fever is known to put even the mightiest
      warrior into fits of anguish for its brief, but hellish duration.

      Rockjoint is a pervasive and ubiquitous disease across Tamriel. Every
      adventurer, noble lord, or peasant farmer has either had Rockjoint, or has
      personally known someone with Rockjoint. Rockjoint swells the knees and
      elbows with sensitive and painful fluids that bloat and then stiffen, and
      can lead to total immobility if left unchecked.

      Rust Chancre is a mild disease at affects the victim’s skin. Blistering,
      itchy rashes break out in random patches across the victim’s body, often
      including their face and neck. The crackled rashes are quite off-putting
      to others, and irritating to the sufferer, but ultimately it is not a
      threatening disease. Rust Chancre often leaves permanent scarring after it
      is cured.

      Swamp Fever is a mild Disease carried typically by mudcrabs and other
      aquatic and amphibious vermin. Swamp Fever causes a high body temperature
      and cold sweats, and is highly contagious, but largely non-threatening.
      The Bitter Coast of Morrowind is notorious for extremely high rates of
      Swamp Fever

      Yellow Tick is a parasite that burrows deep into the victim’s skin. It is
      a relatively mild Disease, but its symptoms include dark, bruised and
      painfully sensitive and itchy swellings where the ticks bury themselves.
      The Yellow Tick causes anemia and muscle atrophy as they feed on the
      victim’s life forces. Yellow Tick is notably contagious during skin
      contact.
