A goblin war-chief is man sized or larger, and those of the nomad clans are even rumoured to be supernaturally protected. Some scholars speculate this to be some sort of blessing from Malacath made manifest, though it warrants further study.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, as the highest-ranking members of a clan, have the best pick of the weapons, armour, food, durzogs, and mates, and they greedily hoard all of these. In a goblin clan, the war-chief is king, and his word is the law. As a result, goblins fear, respect, and envy their chiefs, which results in both total loyalty and murderous betrayal. A goblin war-chief must be careful to keep his berserkers and officers in line, lest they attempt to usurp him.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, unlike goblin berserkers, will retreat if it is warranted, or if they can fall back to a strategic position or ambush. At worst, a goblin war-chief commands enough respect to rally his clan to make a counter-attack at a later date, but to not retaliate at all would certainly result in being cast down; as a result, any attack on a goblin clan is viewed as a personal insult to the war-chief.</p>\n<p>GMs running campaigns that feature goblins as primary antagonists shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to deviate from the stats presented here to give a war-chief Talents from the Character creation chapter in the 3e Core Rules, or to give them magic weapons and armour to help differentiate war-chiefs of different clans, or successors to previously killed war-chiefs.

Purging rat dens is a quintessential adventurer&rsquo;s quest, and rat-killer is a perfectly reasonable career in large cities like Mournhold or Whiterun.</p>\n<p>Cave Rats are defensive in their dens, and aggressively raid settlements, typically during the night, for anything they can eat. When fought, rats tend to flee when they realize they are in danger, but they are just as likely to be suicidally courageous, throwing themselves at their opponent with reckless abandon without awareness the mortal danger they are in.</p>\n<p>When fought in their den, after fleeing rats will typically regroup for a cunning ambush later on.</p>\n<h2>Cave Rat Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On a +30 Survival test, a character can harvest one day's ration of rat meat.

Often, there are dozens, or hundreds of smaller spiderlings under the command of a larger mother spider, and her handful of mates. Capable of crawling on ceilings and walls, giant spiders weave powerful webs to entangle victims, who are then liquified with deadly poison and feasted upon. They will lie in wait to ambush larger prey, but are unafraid of charging weaker, man sized prey head on. The spiders can also use their deadly venom as projectiles, spitting it in large globs to weaken their prey from a distance.</p>\n<p>Though giant spiders are ambush hunters, desperation for food may drive them to take a more proactive approach to hunting, which may result in attacks away from their lair on the road, or in small villages.

Purging rat dens is a quintessential adventurer&rsquo;s quest, and rat-killer is a perfectly reasonable career in large cities like Mournhold or Whiterun.</p>\n<p>Cave Rats are defensive in their dens, and aggressively raid settlements, typically during the night, for anything they can eat. When fought, rats tend to flee when they realize they are in danger, but they are just as likely to be suicidally courageous, throwing themselves at their opponent with reckless abandon without awareness the mortal danger they are in.</p>\n<p>When fought in their den, after fleeing rats will typically regroup for a cunning ambush later on.</p>\n<h2>Cave Rat Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On a +30 Survival test, a character can harvest one day's ration of rat meat.

At worst, a goblin war-chief commands enough respect to rally his clan to make a counter-attack at a later date, but to not retaliate at all would certainly result in being cast down; as a result, any attack on a goblin clan is viewed as a personal insult to the war-chief.</p>\n<p>GMs running campaigns that feature goblins as primary antagonists shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to deviate from the stats presented here to give a war-chief Talents from the Character creation chapter in the 3e Core Rules, or to give them magic weapons and armour to help differentiate war-chiefs of different clans, or successors to previously killed war-chiefs. Even one Combat or Weapon talent can help give a goblin war- chief a lot of mechanical personality.</p>\n<h2>Goblin War-Chief Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A goblin war-chief has on its person what it is equipped with, in addition to about 2d10 drakes worth of trophies weighing 1 ENC.</li>\n<li>A character can make a +0 Alchemy test to harvest a goblin ear, which is an Uncommon Destruction ingredient.
