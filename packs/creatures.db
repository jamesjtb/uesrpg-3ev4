A goblin war-chief is man sized or larger, and those of the nomad clans are even rumoured to be supernaturally protected. Some scholars speculate this to be some sort of blessing from Malacath made manifest, though it warrants further study.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, as the highest-ranking members of a clan, have the best pick of the weapons, armour, food, durzogs, and mates, and they greedily hoard all of these. In a goblin clan, the war-chief is king, and his word is the law. As a result, goblins fear, respect, and envy their chiefs, which results in both total loyalty and murderous betrayal. A goblin war-chief must be careful to keep his berserkers and officers in line, lest they attempt to usurp him.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, unlike goblin berserkers, will retreat if it is warranted, or if they can fall back to a strategic position or ambush. At worst, a goblin war-chief commands enough respect to rally his clan to make a counter-attack at a later date, but to not retaliate at all would certainly result in being cast down; as a result, any attack on a goblin clan is viewed as a personal insult to the war-chief.</p>\n<p>GMs running campaigns that feature goblins as primary antagonists shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to deviate from the stats presented here to give a war-chief Talents from the Character creation chapter in the 3e Core Rules, or to give them magic weapons and armour to help differentiate war-chiefs of different clans, or successors to previously killed war-chiefs. Even one Combat or Weapon talent can help give a goblin war- chief a lot of mechanical personality.</p>\n<h2>Goblin War-Chief Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A goblin war-chief has on its person what it is equipped with, in addition to about 2d10 drakes worth of trophies weighing 1 ENC.</li>\n<li>A character can make a +0 Alchemy test to harvest a goblin ear, which is an Uncommon Destruction ingredient.

On the battlefield, goblin berserkers use their bulk and fury to their advantage, and press constantly on the attack, often forgoing defense in favour of ruthless and unending strikes. They often use either a broad two handed weapon they can swing with reckless abandon, or a pair of weapons to maximize their offensive output, forsaking shields in favour of heavier, more prestigious goblin armour worthy of their social status.</p>\n<p>Although goblins are typically a minor threat at best against experienced warriors, many have been caught off-guard by a goblin berserker&rsquo;s insane lack of self preservation: their rank in goblin society depends on their might and fearlessness, and to lose face would be worse than death.</p>\n<p>Goblin berserkers typically do not parry incoming blows, but are surprisingly deft and capable of dodging should they need to.

From Morrowind, to Skyrim, to the heartlands of Cyrodiil, all the way to the golden yellow coasts of Summerset, mudcrabs can be found. Mudcrabs often lurk in the shallow waters, or on the waterfronts of virtually any body of salt or fresh water, sifting the sand with their filter mouths for food.</p>\n<p>Mudcrabs are often docile, or at least non- confrontational, but many otherwise unaware travellers or fishers find themselves literally tripping and stumbling on mudcrabs they thought were just rocks or driftwood, to which the mudcrabs do not take too kindly. Mudcrabs will cry out to rally other mudcrabs in the area to repell aggressors from their feeding grounds if they feel threatened, and will pursue targets an unreasonable distance while giving chase.</p>\n<h2>Mudcrab Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the mudcrab's shell, worth 15 drakes, over the course of a Short Rest.

Ogres raiding settlements is far from unheard of, and often a legitimate concern for those in the frontier regions in Cyrodiil, though these raids most often end in stolen livestock rather than sacked villages.

A goblin war-chief is man sized or larger, and those of the nomad clans are even rumoured to be supernaturally protected. Some scholars speculate this to be some sort of blessing from Malacath made manifest, though it warrants further study.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, as the highest-ranking members of a clan, have the best pick of the weapons, armour, food, durzogs, and mates, and they greedily hoard all of these. In a goblin clan, the war-chief is king, and his word is the law. As a result, goblins fear, respect, and envy their chiefs, which results in both total loyalty and murderous betrayal. A goblin war-chief must be careful to keep his berserkers and officers in line, lest they attempt to usurp him.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, unlike goblin berserkers, will retreat if it is warranted, or if they can fall back to a strategic position or ambush. At worst, a goblin war-chief commands enough respect to rally his clan to make a counter-attack at a later date, but to not retaliate at all would certainly result in being cast down; as a result, any attack on a goblin clan is viewed as a personal insult to the war-chief.</p>\n<p>GMs running campaigns that feature goblins as primary antagonists shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to deviate from the stats presented here to give a war-chief Talents from the Character creation chapter in the 3e Core Rules, or to give them magic weapons and armour to help differentiate war-chiefs of different clans, or successors to previously killed war-chiefs. Even one Combat or Weapon talent can help give a goblin war- chief a lot of mechanical personality.</p>\n<h2>Goblin War-Chief Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A goblin war-chief has on its person what it is equipped with, in addition to about 2d10 drakes worth of trophies weighing 1 ENC.</li>\n<li>A character can make a +0 Alchemy test to harvest a goblin ear, which is an Uncommon Destruction ingredient.

They are generally encountered either naked or sparsely clothed, with visible wounds and openings rotted into their chest and abdomen. If a corpse is fresh enough, it could even pass as a living creature, given thick enough clothes and a particularly convincing master. They are cheap for necromancers to produce since they do not require weapons like a skeleton; only some magicka and a corpse with most of its flesh intact. Though able to move via magic, their rotted forms make them frail and weak. As such, they are often used by necromancers in swarms, overwhelming their foes in a horde of gouging digits and flailing appendages.</p>\n<p>Despite most being minions that lack individual strength, some zombies break this mold. Dread zombies are a particularly dangerous type of zombie. They are stronger, tougher, some say even smarter, than the average zombie. The magic that suffuses their being is also able to slowly heal any wounds acquired after their creation. Perhaps the most insidious feature of a dread zombie is a magical blight that infects its tissues called Astral Vapors.</p>\n<h2>Zombie Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A character can attempt a +0 Alchemy test during a Short Rest to harvest a dose of Mort Flesh, which is an Uncommon Destruction ingredient.

Usually found in or around ancient ruins or guarding a necromancer&rsquo;s lair, they can be potent foes against the average adventurer and pose a serious threat to untrained combatants. More experienced adventurers should have no problem disposing of them, but they tend to have numbers on their side. Additionally, due to their lack of internal organs and not needing core body muscles to function, many otherwise well-placed blows and thrusts will go cleanly between their ribs and other bones, leaving them mostly unscathed.</p>\n<p>If encountered as a servant to a necromancer, a skeleton will fiercely fight to protect its master, as it is bound by the black magics holding it together to do so as its imperative task. Skeletons under direct control of a necromancer are able to fight intelligently, acting as an extension of the necromancer himself.</p>\n<p>If found without a master, a skeleton will usually attack anything on sight for no apparent reason.

Wild horses spook easily, and are very fast. Fighting wild horses is a rare occurence due to their preference to flee, but an angry horse is no laughing matter.</p>\n<p>In combat, a horse will trample its foes with its large, powerful hooves, or by charging and headbutting its foes before stomping on them when they are underfoot. A horse that is wrangled will buck and kick violently, and its not unheard of for errant stablehands to be brutally killed by their charges.</p>\n<p>For this reason, particularly angry or poorly tempered destriers are the preferred war horses of the peoples of Tamriel, though the horses themselves are as varied as man and mer alike.

Additionally, a Dragon Priest is equally proficient in all Schools of magic, and as a result can take spells from any school. The GM is encouraged to create a creative and powerful spell list, and really take advantage of the Imbued with Magicka trait to really go crazy with spells. For example, while a Dragon Priest does not innately have the Fly trait, because it is able to cast without spending Magicka it can effectively have a level 7 Levitate at all times.</p>\n<p>A party needs to be prepared with sufficient antimagic, because a Dragon Priest has no reason to hold back its awe-inspiring destructive powers, because it is not confined to the mortal understandings of magic.

This has lead some necrologists to speculate that gloom wraiths are the cursed spirits of members of nobility, or even royalty.</p>\n<h2>Wraith Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When a wraith dies, it vanishes, including its spectral armour and weapons.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>A character can test a -10 Alchemy test to gather one dose of Ectoplasm, which is a Very Rare Mysticism ingredient.</li>\n</ul>","soul_energy":"350 White Soul","journal":"","notes":"","lucky_numbers":"","unlucky_numbers":"","supply":"1d2","supply_cat":{"1d2":"1d2","1d4":"1d4","1d6":"1d6","1d8":"1d8","1d10":"1d10"},"wealth":0,"current_enc":0,"carry_rating":{"current":0,"max":24,"bonus":0},"characteristics":{"str":{"value":40,"favored":false},"end":{"value":45,"favored":false},"agi":{"value":40,"favored":false},"int":{"value":40,"favored":false},"wp":{"value":45,"favored":false},"prc":{"value":25,"favored":false},"prs":{"value":5,"favored":false},"lck":{"value":null,"favored":false}},"proficiencies":{"combat":0,"magic":0,"evade":0,"observe":0,"stealth":0,"knowledge":0,"social":0,"physical":0},"hp":{"base":23,"current":0,"max":41,"temp":0,"bonus":18,"value":41},"action_points":{"current":3,"max":3,"value":0},"luck_points":{"current":0,"max":0,"value":null},"stamina":{"current":0,"max":4,"bonus":0,"value":4},"magicka":{"current":0,"max":150,"bonus":110,"value":150},"xp":0,"wound_threshold":{"base":15,"bonus":3},"initiative":{"base":10,"bonus":0},"speed":{"base":12,"bonus":0},"size":"standard","size_cat":{"puny":"Puny","tiny":"Tiny","small":"Small","standard":"Standard","large":"Large","huge":"Huge","enormous":"Enormous"},"skill_ranks":{"untrained":{"name":"Untrained","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"novice":{"name":" (0) Novice","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"apprentice":{"name":"(1) Apprentice","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"journeyman":{"name":"(2) Journeyman","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"adept":{"name":"(3) Adept","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"expert":{"name":"(4) Expert","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"master":{"name":"(5) Master","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"athletics":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"command":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"commerce":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"deceive":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"evade":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"investigate":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"logic":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"lore":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"navigate":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"observe":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"persuade":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"profession1":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","name":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"profession2":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","name":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"profession3":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","name":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"ride":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"stealth":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"subterfuge":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"survival":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0}},"magic_skills":{"alchemy":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"alteration":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"conjuration":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"destruction":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"enchant":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"illusion":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"mysticism":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"restoration":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0},"necromancy":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","characteristic":"","tn":0}},"talents":"<h2>Weapons and Armour</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spectral Claws:</strong> d8 Slashing; 1m.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>May have any of:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gloom Longsword: </strong>d8 (d10) Slashing; 2m.</li>\n<li><strong>Ethereal Sabre:</strong> d8 Slashing; Duelling Weapon, 2m.</li>\n<li><strong>Ghostly Staff:</strong> d6, Innate Spell, 2m.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A Wraith&rsquo;s Staff is infused with a spell, that can be cast costing 0 Magicka, and always succeeds with 1 DoS.

A goblin war-chief is man sized or larger, and those of the nomad clans are even rumoured to be supernaturally protected. Some scholars speculate this to be some sort of blessing from Malacath made manifest, though it warrants further study.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, as the highest-ranking members of a clan, have the best pick of the weapons, armour, food, durzogs, and mates, and they greedily hoard all of these. In a goblin clan, the war-chief is king, and his word is the law. As a result, goblins fear, respect, and envy their chiefs, which results in both total loyalty and murderous betrayal. A goblin war-chief must be careful to keep his berserkers and officers in line, lest they attempt to usurp him.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, unlike goblin berserkers, will retreat if it is warranted, or if they can fall back to a strategic position or ambush. At worst, a goblin war-chief commands enough respect to rally his clan to make a counter-attack at a later date, but to not retaliate at all would certainly result in being cast down; as a result, any attack on a goblin clan is viewed as a personal insult to the war-chief.</p>\n<p>GMs running campaigns that feature goblins as primary antagonists shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to deviate from the stats presented here to give a war-chief Talents from the Character creation chapter in the 3e Core Rules, or to give them magic weapons and armour to help differentiate war-chiefs of different clans, or successors to previously killed war-chiefs.
